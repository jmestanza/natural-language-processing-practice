The grey pavement\\nhad been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so\\nthat there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction\\nof the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman\\nwhose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\\n\\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a\\nmassive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed\\nin a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat\\nbrown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were\\nin absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was\\nrunning hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives\\nwho is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he\\njerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face\\ninto the most extraordinary contortions.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat on earth can be the matter with him?\\u201d I asked. \\u201cHe is looking up\\nat the numbers of the houses.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI believe that he is coming here,\\u201d said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\\n\\n\\u201cHere?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think\\nthat I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?\\u201d As he spoke,\\nthe man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell\\nuntil the whole house resounded with the clanging.\\n\\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still\\ngesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his\\neyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For\\na while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked\\nat his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his\\nreason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against\\nthe wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away\\nto the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the\\neasy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with\\nhim in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have come to me to tell your story, have you not?\\u201d said he. \\u201cYou\\nare fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered\\nyourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little\\nproblem which you may submit to me.\\u201d\\n\\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against\\nhis emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his\\nlips tight, and turned his face towards us.\\n\\n\\u201cNo doubt you think me mad?\\u201d said he.\\n\\n\\u201cI see that you have had some great trouble,\\u201d responded Holmes.\\n\\n\\u201cGod knows I have!\\u2014a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so\\nsudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced,\\nalthough I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.\\nPrivate affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming\\ntogether, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very\\nsoul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may\\nsuffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPray compose yourself, sir,\\u201d said Holmes, \\u201cand let me have a clear\\naccount of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy name,\\u201d answered our visitor, \\u201cis probably familiar to your ears. I\\nam Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of\\nThreadneedle Street.\\u201d\\n\\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner\\nin the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.\\nWhat could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens\\nof London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until\\nwith another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\\n\\n\\u201cI feel that time is of value,\\u201d said he; \\u201cthat is why I hastened here\\nwhen the police inspector suggested that I should secure your\\nco-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried\\nfrom there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is\\nwhy I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little\\nexercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as\\nshortly and yet as clearly as I can.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking\\nbusiness as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative\\ninvestments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the\\nnumber of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out\\nmoney is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We\\nhave done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and\\nthere are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon\\nthe security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\\n\\n\\u201cYesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card\\nwas brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the\\nname, for it was that of none other than\\u2014well, perhaps even to you I\\nhad better say no more than that it was a name which is a household\\nword all over the earth\\u2014one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names\\nin England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he\\nentered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air\\nof a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Mr. Holder,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018I have been informed that you are in the habit\\nof advancing money.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018The firm does so when the security is good.\\u2019 I answered.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018It is absolutely essential to me,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018that I should have \\u00a3\\n50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times\\nover from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business\\nand to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily\\nunderstand that it is unwise to place one\\u2019s self under obligations.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?\\u2019 I asked.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most\\ncertainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it\\nright to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should\\nbe paid at once.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own\\nprivate purse,\\u2019 said I, \\u2018were it not that the strain would be rather\\nmore than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the\\nname of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that,\\neven in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018I should much prefer to have it so,\\u2019 said he, raising up a square,\\nblack morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. \\u2018You have\\ndoubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,\\u2019 said I.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Precisely.\\u2019 He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,\\nflesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he\\nhad named. \\u2018There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018and the\\nprice of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would\\nput the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am\\nprepared to leave it with you as my security.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cI took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity\\nfrom it to my illustrious client.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018You doubt its value?\\u2019 he asked.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Not at all. I only doubt\\u2014\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about\\nthat. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain\\nthat I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter\\nof form. Is the security sufficient?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Ample.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of\\nthe confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard\\nof you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all\\ngossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with\\nevery possible precaution because I need not say that a great public\\nscandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it\\nwould be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no\\nberyls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to\\nreplace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and\\nI shall call for it in person on Monday morning.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cSeeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,\\ncalling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty \\u00a3 1000 notes.\\nWhen I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon\\nthe table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of\\nthe immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no\\ndoubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would\\nensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having\\never consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter\\nthe matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once\\nmore to my work.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so\\nprecious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers\\u2019 safes had been\\nforced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible\\nwould be the position in which I should find myself! I determined,\\ntherefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case\\nbackward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of\\nmy reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house\\nat Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely\\nuntil I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my\\ndressing-room.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to\\nthoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of\\nthe house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants\\nwho have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability\\nis quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid,\\nhas only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent\\ncharacter, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very\\npretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about\\nthe place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we\\nbelieve her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\\n\\n\\u201cSo much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will\\nnot take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son,\\nArthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes\\u2014a grievous\\ndisappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell\\nme that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died\\nI felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile\\nfade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish.\\nPerhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner,\\nbut I meant it for the best.\\n\\n\\u201cIt was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my\\nbusiness, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and,\\nto speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums\\nof money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club,\\nand there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a\\nnumber of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play\\nheavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again\\nand again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his\\nallowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than\\nonce to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but\\neach time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough\\nto draw him back again.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell\\nshould gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to\\nmy house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the\\nfascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world\\nto his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a\\nbrilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think\\nof him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am\\nconvinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in\\nhis eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think,\\nand so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman\\u2019s quick insight\\ninto character.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when\\nmy brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I\\nadopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is\\na sunbeam in my house\\u2014sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and\\nhousekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be.\\nShe is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In\\nonly one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has\\nasked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she\\nhas refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the\\nright path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have\\nchanged his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late\\u2014forever too late!\\n\\n\\u201cNow, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I\\nshall continue with my miserable story.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after\\ndinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious\\ntreasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my\\nclient. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left\\nthe room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur\\nwere much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I\\nthought it better not to disturb it.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Where have you put it?\\u2019 asked Arthur.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018In my own bureau.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Well, I hope to goodness the house won\\u2019t be burgled during the\\nnight.\\u2019 said he.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018It is locked up,\\u2019 I answered.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have\\nopened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cHe often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what\\nhe said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very\\ngrave face.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Look here, dad,\\u2019 said he with his eyes cast down, \\u2018can you let me\\nhave \\u00a3 200?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018No, I cannot!\\u2019 I answered sharply. \\u2018I have been far too generous with\\nyou in money matters.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018You have been very kind,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018but I must have this money, or\\nelse I can never show my face inside the club again.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018And a very good thing, too!\\u2019 I cried.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,\\u2019 said he.\\n\\u2018I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and\\nif you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cI was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. \\u2018You\\nshall not have a farthing from me,\\u2019 I cried, on which he bowed and left\\nthe room without another word.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was\\nsafe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see\\nthat all was secure\\u2014a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I\\nthought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs\\nI saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and\\nfastened as I approached.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Tell me, dad,\\u2019 said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, \\u2018did\\nyou give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Certainly not.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has\\nonly been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is\\nhardly safe and should be stopped.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are\\nyou sure that everything is fastened?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Quite sure, dad.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Then, good-night.\\u2019 I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again,\\nwhere I was soon asleep.\\n\\n\\u201cI am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have\\nany bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any\\npoint which I do not make clear.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOn the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be\\nparticularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my\\nmind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in\\nthe morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had\\nceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as\\nthough a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all\\nmy ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of\\nfootsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all\\npalpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room\\ndoor.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Arthur!\\u2019 I screamed, \\u2018you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that\\ncoronet?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cThe gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed\\nonly in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding\\nthe coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending\\nit with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and\\nturned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the\\ngold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018You blackguard!\\u2019 I shouted, beside myself with rage. \\u2018You have\\ndestroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels\\nwhich you have stolen?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Stolen!\\u2019 he cried.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Yes, thief!\\u2019 I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,\\u2019 said he.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you\\na liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another\\npiece?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018You have called me names enough,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018I will not stand it any\\nlonger. I shall not say another word about this business, since you\\nhave chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and\\nmake my own way in the world.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018You shall leave it in the hands of the police!\\u2019 I cried half-mad with\\ngrief and rage. \\u2018I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018You shall learn nothing from me,\\u2019 said he with a passion such as I\\nshould not have thought was in his nature. \\u2018If you choose to call the\\npolice, let the police find what they can.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cBy this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in\\nmy anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of\\nthe coronet and of Arthur\\u2019s face, she read the whole story and, with a\\nscream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the\\npolice and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the\\ninspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood\\nsullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to\\ncharge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private\\nmatter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was\\nnational property. I was determined that the law should have its way in\\neverything.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018At least,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018you will not have me arrested at once. It would\\nbe to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for\\nfive minutes.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have\\nstolen,\\u2019 said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I\\nwas placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that\\nof one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened\\nto raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it\\nall if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing\\nstones.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018You may as well face the matter,\\u2019 said I; \\u2018you have been caught in\\nthe act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you\\nbut make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the\\nberyls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,\\u2019 he answered, turning\\naway from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words\\nof mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the\\ninspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only\\nof his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where\\nhe could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could\\nbe found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our\\npersuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and\\nI, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round\\nto you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The\\npolice have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of\\nit. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already\\noffered a reward of \\u00a3 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my\\nhonour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!\\u201d\\n\\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro,\\ndroning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted\\nand his eyes fixed upon the fire.\\n\\n\\u201cDo you receive much company?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\n\\u201cNone save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of\\nArthur\\u2019s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one\\nelse, I think.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDo you go out much in society?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cArthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat is unusual in a young girl.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cShe is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is\\nfour-and-twenty.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThis matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her\\nalso.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTerrible! She is even more affected than I.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou have neither of you any doubt as to your son\\u2019s guilt?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in\\nhis hands.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the\\ncoronet at all injured?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, it was twisted.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDo you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten\\nit?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGod bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it\\nis too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose\\nwere innocent, why did he not say so?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPrecisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His\\nsilence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular\\npoints about the case. What did the police think of the noise which\\nawoke you from your sleep?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey considered that it might be caused by Arthur\\u2019s closing his\\nbedroom door.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cA likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as\\nto wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of\\nthese gems?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the\\nhope of finding them.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHave they thought of looking outside the house?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has\\nalready been minutely examined.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNow, my dear sir,\\u201d said Holmes, \\u201cis it not obvious to you now that\\nthis matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the\\npolice were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a\\nsimple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is\\ninvolved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his\\nbed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,\\ntook out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it,\\nwent off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the\\nthirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then\\nreturned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed\\nhimself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is\\nsuch a theory tenable?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut what other is there?\\u201d cried the banker with a gesture of despair.\\n\\u201cIf his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt is our task to find that out,\\u201d replied Holmes; \\u201cso now, if you\\nplease, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote\\nan hour to glancing a little more closely into details.\\u201d\\n\\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which\\nI was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply\\nstirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt\\nof the banker\\u2019s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his\\nunhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes\\u2019 judgment that I\\nfelt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was\\ndissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the\\nwhole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his\\nbreast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.\\nOur client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of\\nhope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a\\ndesultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway\\njourney and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence\\nof the great financier.\\n\\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a\\nlittle from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,\\nstretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the\\nentrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into\\na narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the\\nkitchen door, and forming the tradesmen\\u2019s entrance. On the left ran a\\nlane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at\\nall, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us\\nstanding at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the\\nfront, down the tradesmen\\u2019s path, and so round by the garden behind\\ninto the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into\\nthe dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were\\nsitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\\nShe was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,\\nwhich seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do\\nnot think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman\\u2019s face.\\nHer lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.\\nAs she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater\\nsense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the\\nmore striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,\\nwith immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she\\nwent straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a\\nsweet womanly caress.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,\\ndad?\\u201d she asked.\\n\\n\\u201cNo, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman\\u2019s instincts\\nare. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for\\nhaving acted so harshly.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhy is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWho knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect\\nhim.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\\ncoronet in his hand?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my\\nword for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more.\\nIt is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI shall never let it drop until the gems are found\\u2014never, Mary! Your\\naffection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\\nfrom hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London\\nto inquire more deeply into it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThis gentleman?\\u201d she asked, facing round to me.\\n\\n\\u201cNo, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the\\nstable lane now.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe stable lane?\\u201d She raised her dark eyebrows. \\u201cWhat can he hope to\\nfind there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will\\nsucceed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin\\nArthur is innocent of this crime.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove\\nit,\\u201d returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his\\nshoes. \\u201cI believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder.\\nMight I ask you a question or two?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou heard nothing yourself last night?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and\\nI came down.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all\\nthe windows?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWere they all fastened this morning?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to\\nyour uncle last night that she had been out to see him?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may\\nhave heard uncle\\u2019s remarks about the coronet.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,\\nand that the two may have planned the robbery.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut what is the good of all these vague theories,\\u201d cried the banker\\nimpatiently, \\u201cwhen I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet\\nin his hands?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,\\nMiss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met\\nher slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDo you know him?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His\\nname is Francis Prosper.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe stood,\\u201d said Holmes, \\u201cto the left of the door\\u2014that is to say,\\nfarther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, he did.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd he is a man with a wooden leg?\\u201d\\n\\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady\\u2019s expressive black\\neyes. \\u201cWhy, you are like a magician,\\u201d said she. \\u201cHow do you know that?\\u201d\\nShe smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes\\u2019 thin, eager\\nface.\\n\\n\\u201cI should be very glad now to go upstairs,\\u201d said he. \\u201cI shall probably\\nwish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better\\ntake a look at the lower windows before I go up.\\u201d\\n\\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the\\nlarge one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he\\nopened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his\\npowerful magnifying lens. \\u201cNow we shall go upstairs,\\u201d said he at last.\\n\\nThe banker\\u2019s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with\\na grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the\\nbureau first and looked hard at the lock.\\n\\n\\u201cWhich key was used to open it?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\n\\u201cThat which my son himself indicated\\u2014that of the cupboard of the\\nlumber-room.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHave you it here?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat is it on the dressing-table.\\u201d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is a noiseless lock,\\u201d said he. \\u201cIt is no wonder that it did not\\nwake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a\\nlook at it.\\u201d He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it\\nupon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller\\u2019s art,\\nand the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one\\nside of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three\\ngems had been torn away.\\n\\n\\u201cNow, Mr. Holder,\\u201d said Holmes, \\u201chere is the corner which corresponds\\nto that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will\\nbreak it off.\\u201d\\n\\nThe banker recoiled in horror. \\u201cI should not dream of trying,\\u201d said he.\\n\\n\\u201cThen I will.\\u201d Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without\\nresult. \\u201cI feel it give a little,\\u201d said he; \\u201cbut, though I am\\nexceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to\\nbreak it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would\\nhappen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a\\npistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards\\nof your bed and that you heard nothing of it?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss\\nHolder?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI confess that I still share my uncle\\u2019s perplexity.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYour son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck\\nduring this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not\\nsucceed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I\\nshall now continue my investigations outside.\\u201d\\n\\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any\\nunnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour\\nor more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow\\nand his features as inscrutable as ever.\\n\\n\\u201cI think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,\\u201d\\nsaid he; \\u201cI can serve you best by returning to my rooms.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI cannot tell.\\u201d\\n\\nThe banker wrung his hands. \\u201cI shall never see them again!\\u201d he cried.\\n\\u201cAnd my son? You give me hopes?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy opinion is in no way altered.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen, for God\\u2019s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in\\nmy house last night?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIf you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning\\nbetween nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it\\nclearer. I understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you,\\nprovided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on\\nthe sum I may draw.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI would give my fortune to have them back.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cVery good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.\\nGood-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again\\nbefore evening.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was obvious to me that my companion\\u2019s mind was now made up about the\\ncase, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even\\ndimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured\\nto sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other\\ntopic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three\\nwhen we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his\\nchamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer.\\nWith his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and\\nhis worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\\n\\n\\u201cI think that this should do,\\u201d said he, glancing into the glass above\\nthe fireplace. \\u201cI only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I\\nfear that it won\\u2019t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may\\nbe following a will-o\\u2019-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I\\nhope that I may be back in a few hours.\\u201d He cut a slice of beef from\\nthe joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of\\nbread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon\\nhis expedition.\\n\\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent\\nspirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it\\ndown into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\\n\\n\\u201cI only looked in as I passed,\\u201d said he. \\u201cI am going right on.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere to?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I\\nget back. Don\\u2019t wait up for me in case I should be late.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow are you getting on?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since\\nI saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet\\nlittle problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.\\nHowever, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable\\nclothes off and return to my highly respectable self.\\u201d\\n\\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction\\nthan his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even\\na touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a\\nfew minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that\\nhe was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\\n\\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I\\nretired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for\\ndays and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his\\nlateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in,\\nbut when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a\\ncup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim\\nas possible.\\n\\n\\u201cYou will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,\\u201d said he, \\u201cbut you\\nremember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhy, it is after nine now,\\u201d I answered. \\u201cI should not be surprised if\\nthat were he. I thought I heard a ring.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change\\nwhich had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad\\nand massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed\\nto me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy\\nwhich was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,\\nand he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for\\nhim.\\n\\n\\u201cI do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,\\u201d said he.\\n\\u201cOnly two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in\\nthe world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow\\ncomes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted\\nme.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDeserted you?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,\\nand a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last\\nnight, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all\\nmight have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say\\nso. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\\n\\n    \\u201c\\u2018MY DEAREST UNCLE,\\u2014I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,\\n    and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might\\n    never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever\\n    again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you\\n    forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for;\\n    and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless\\n    labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever\\n    your loving,\\n\\n\\n    \\u201c\\u2018MARY.\\u2019\\n\\n\\n\\u201cWhat could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points\\nto suicide?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution.\\nI trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHa! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned\\nsomething! Where are the gems?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou would not think \\u00a3 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI would pay ten.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And\\nthere is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a\\npen. Better make it out for \\u00a3 4000.\\u201d\\n\\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked\\nover to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three\\ngems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\\n\\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have it!\\u201d he gasped. \\u201cI am saved! I am saved!\\u201d\\n\\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he\\nhugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,\\u201d said Sherlock Holmes\\nrather sternly.\\n\\n\\u201cOwe!\\u201d He caught up a pen. \\u201cName the sum, and I will pay it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble\\nlad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be\\nproud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen it was not Arthur who took them?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know\\nthat the truth is known.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview\\nwith him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to\\nhim, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very\\nfew details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this\\nmorning, however, may open his lips.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFor Heaven\\u2019s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And\\nlet me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and\\nfor you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George\\nBurnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy Mary? Impossible!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor\\nyour son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into\\nyour family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England\\u2014a\\nruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or\\nconscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his\\nvows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered\\nherself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what\\nhe said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of\\nseeing him nearly every evening.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI cannot, and I will not, believe it!\\u201d cried the banker with an ashen\\nface.\\n\\n\\u201cI will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your\\nniece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down\\nand talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable\\nlane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he\\nstood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold\\nkindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that\\nshe loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover\\nextinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.\\nShe had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\\ndownstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about\\none of the servants\\u2019 escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was\\nall perfectly true.\\n\\n\\u201cYour boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he\\nslept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the\\nmiddle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose\\nand, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very\\nstealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your\\ndressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some\\nclothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this\\nstrange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the\\nlight of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious\\ncoronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling\\nwith horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,\\nwhence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her\\nstealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the\\ngloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing\\nquite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\\n\\n\\u201cAs long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a\\nhorrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she\\nwas gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you,\\nand how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as\\nhe was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow,\\nand ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the\\nmoonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught\\nhim, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one\\nside of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle,\\nyour son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something\\nsuddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his\\nhands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had\\njust observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was\\nendeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIs it possible?\\u201d gasped the banker.\\n\\n\\u201cYou then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he\\nfelt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the\\ntrue state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved\\nlittle enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous\\nview, however, and preserved her secret.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,\\u201d\\ncried Mr. Holder. \\u201cOh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his\\nasking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted\\nto see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How\\ncruelly I have misjudged him!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhen I arrived at the house,\\u201d continued Holmes, \\u201cI at once went very\\ncarefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow\\nwhich might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening\\nbefore, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve\\nimpressions. I passed along the tradesmen\\u2019s path, but found it all\\ntrampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the\\nfar side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,\\nwhose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I\\ncould even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run\\nback swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel\\nmarks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I\\nthought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of\\nwhom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I\\npassed round the garden without seeing anything more than random\\ntracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable\\nlane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of\\nme.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\\nline which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was\\nat once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your\\nson. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and\\nas his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it\\nwas obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and\\nfound they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow\\naway while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred\\nyards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where\\nthe snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,\\nwhere a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not\\nmistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge\\nof blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the\\nhigh road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared,\\nso there was an end to that clue.\\n\\n\\u201cOn entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill\\nand framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see\\nthat someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an\\ninstep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then\\nbeginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man\\nhad waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed\\nhad been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled\\nwith him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength\\ncausing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had\\nreturned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his\\nopponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man, and\\nwho was it brought him the coronet?\\n\\n\\u201cIt is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew\\nthat it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained\\nyour niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son\\nallow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible\\nreason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent\\nexplanation why he should retain her secret\\u2014the more so as the secret\\nwas a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that\\nwindow, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my\\nconjecture became a certainty.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for\\nwho else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to\\nyou? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends\\nwas a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had\\nheard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It\\nmust have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.\\nEven though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still\\nflatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word\\nwithout compromising his own family.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I\\nwent in the shape of a loafer to Sir George\\u2019s house, managed to pick up\\nan acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his\\nhead the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,\\nmade all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I\\njourneyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the\\ntracks.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,\\u201d said Mr.\\nHolder.\\n\\n\\u201cPrecisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and\\nchanged my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then,\\nfor I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I\\nknew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the\\nmatter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything.\\nBut when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to\\nbluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man,\\nhowever, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.\\nThen he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give\\nhim a price for the stones he held\\u2014\\u00a3 1000 apiece. That brought out the\\nfirst signs of grief that he had shown. \\u2018Why, dash it all!\\u2019 said he,\\n\\u2018I\\u2019ve let them go at six hundred for the three!\\u2019 I soon managed to get\\nthe address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there\\nwould be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I\\ngot our stones at \\u00a3 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told\\nhim that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o\\u2019clock,\\nafter what I may call a really hard day\\u2019s work.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cA day which has saved England from a great public scandal,\\u201d said the\\nbanker, rising. \\u201cSir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall\\nnot find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed\\nexceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy\\nto apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you\\ntell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can\\ninform me where she is now.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI think that we may safely say,\\u201d returned Holmes, \\u201cthat she is\\nwherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that\\nwhatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient\\npunishment.\\u201d\",\n          \"THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR\\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long\\nceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which\\nthe unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and\\ntheir more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this\\nfour-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the\\nfull facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my\\nfriend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter\\nup, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little\\nsketch of this remarkable episode.\\n\\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was\\nstill sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from\\nan afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I\\nhad remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn\\nto rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had\\nbrought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign\\nthrobbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my\\nlegs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers\\nuntil at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all\\naside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the\\nenvelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend\\u2019s noble\\ncorrespondent could be.\\n\\n\\u201cHere is a very fashionable epistle,\\u201d I remarked as he entered. \\u201cYour\\nmorning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a\\ntide-waiter.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,\\u201d he\\nanswered, smiling, \\u201cand the humbler are usually the more interesting.\\nThis looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon\\na man either to be bored or to lie.\\u201d\\n\\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\\n\\n\\u201cOh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNot social, then?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, distinctly professional.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd from a noble client?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOne of the highest in England.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy dear fellow, I congratulate you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my\\nclient is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.\\nIt is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this\\nnew investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late,\\nhave you not?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt looks like it,\\u201d said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the\\ncorner. \\u201cI have had nothing else to do.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read\\nnothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is\\nalways instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely\\nyou must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, yes, with the deepest interest.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St.\\nSimon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these\\npapers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he\\nsays:\\n\\n    \\u201c\\u2018MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\\u2014Lord Backwater tells me that I may\\n    place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have\\n    determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in\\n    reference to the very painful event which has occurred in\\n    connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is\\n    acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no\\n    objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it\\n    might be of some assistance. I will call at four o\\u2019clock in the\\n    afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time,\\n    I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount\\n    importance. Yours faithfully,\\n\\n\\n    \\u201c\\u2018ROBERT ST. SIMON.\\u2019\\n\\n\\n\\u201cIt is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the\\nnoble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer\\nside of his right little finger,\\u201d remarked Holmes as he folded up the\\nepistle.\\n\\n\\u201cHe says four o\\u2019clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the\\nsubject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order\\nof time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.\\u201d He picked a\\nred-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the\\nmantelpiece. \\u201cHere he is,\\u201d said he, sitting down and flattening it out\\nupon his knee. \\u201c\\u2018Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son\\nof the Duke of Balmoral.\\u2019 Hum! \\u2018Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief\\nover a fess sable. Born in 1846.\\u2019 He\\u2019s forty-one years of age, which is\\nmature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late\\nadministration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for\\nForeign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and\\nTudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive\\nin all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more\\nsolid.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI have very little difficulty in finding what I want,\\u201d said I, \\u201cfor\\nthe facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I\\nfeared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry\\non hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.\\nThat is quite cleared up now\\u2014though, indeed, it was obvious from the\\nfirst. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHere is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal\\ncolumn of the _Morning Post_, and dates, as you see, some weeks back:\\n\\u2018A marriage has been arranged,\\u2019 it says, \\u2018and will, if rumour is\\ncorrect, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second\\nson of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of\\nAloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.\\u2019 That is all.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTerse and to the point,\\u201d remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin\\nlegs towards the fire.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of\\nthe same week. Ah, here it is: \\u2018There will soon be a call for\\nprotection in the marriage  market, for the present free-trade\\nprinciple appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one\\nthe management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the\\nhands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important\\naddition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes\\nwhich have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon,\\nwho has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little\\ngod\\u2019s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage\\nwith Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California\\nmillionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face\\nattracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only\\nchild, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to\\nconsiderably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As\\nit is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to\\nsell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has\\nno property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is\\nobvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an\\nalliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition\\nfrom a Republican lady to a British peeress.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnything else?\\u201d asked Holmes, yawning.\\n\\n\\u201cOh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the _Morning Post_ to\\nsay that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would\\nbe at St. George\\u2019s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate\\nfriends would be invited, and that the party would return to the\\nfurnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius\\nDoran. Two days later\\u2014that is, on Wednesday last\\u2014there is a curt\\nannouncement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon\\nwould be passed at Lord Backwater\\u2019s place, near Petersfield. Those are\\nall the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the what?\\u201d asked Holmes with a start.\\n\\n\\u201cThe vanishing of the lady.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhen did she vanish, then?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAt the wedding breakfast.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIndeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite\\ndramatic, in fact.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the\\nhoneymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.\\nPray let me have the details.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI warn you that they are very incomplete.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPerhaps we may make them less so.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSuch as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning\\npaper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, \\u2018Singular\\nOccurrence at a Fashionable Wedding\\u2019:\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest\\nconsternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken\\nplace in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly\\nannounced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning;\\nbut it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange\\nrumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the\\nattempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention\\nhas now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by\\naffecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018The ceremony, which was performed at St. George\\u2019s, Hanover Square,\\nwas a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the\\nbride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater,\\nLord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister\\nof the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party\\nproceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster\\nGate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little\\ntrouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who\\nendeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party,\\nalleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after\\na painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and\\nthe footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before\\nthis unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,\\nwhen she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room.\\nHer prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed\\nher, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber\\nfor an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the\\npassage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the\\nhouse thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his\\nmistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that\\nhis daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with\\nthe bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the\\npolice, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will\\nprobably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.\\nUp to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the\\nwhereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the\\nmatter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the\\nwoman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from\\njealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the\\nstrange disappearance of the bride.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd is that all?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOnly one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a\\nsuggestive one.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd it is\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has\\nactually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_\\nat the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.\\nThere are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands\\nnow\\u2014so far as it has been set forth in the public press.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have\\nmissed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as\\nthe clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this\\nwill prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I\\nvery much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own\\nmemory.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cLord Robert St. Simon,\\u201d announced our page-boy, throwing open the\\ndoor. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed\\nand pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with\\nthe steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever\\nbeen to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his\\ngeneral appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight\\nforward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair,\\ntoo, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the\\nedges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the\\nverge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white\\nwaistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured\\ngaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left\\nto right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden\\neyeglasses.\\n\\n\\u201cGood-day, Lord St. Simon,\\u201d said Holmes, rising and bowing. \\u201cPray take\\nthe basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up\\na little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cA most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.\\nHolmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have\\nalready managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I\\npresume that they were hardly from the same class of society.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, I am descending.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI beg pardon.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy last client of the sort was a king.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, really! I had no idea. And which king?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe King of Scandinavia.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat! Had he lost his wife?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou can understand,\\u201d said Holmes suavely, \\u201cthat I extend to the\\naffairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in\\nyours.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOf course! Very right! very right! I\\u2019m sure I beg pardon. As to my own\\ncase, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in\\nforming an opinion.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,\\nnothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct\\u2014this article, for\\nexample, as to the disappearance of the bride.\\u201d\\n\\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. \\u201cYes, it is correct, as far as it\\ngoes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer\\nan opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by\\nquestioning you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPray do so.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhen did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIn San Francisco, a year ago.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou were travelling in the States?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDid you become engaged then?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut you were on a friendly footing?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHer father is very rich?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd how did he make his money?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIn mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,\\ninvested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNow, what is your own impression as to the young lady\\u2019s\\u2014your wife\\u2019s\\ncharacter?\\u201d\\n\\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the\\nfire. \\u201cYou see, Mr. Holmes,\\u201d said he, \\u201cmy wife was twenty before her\\nfather became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining\\ncamp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has\\ncome from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call\\nin England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by\\nany sort of traditions. She is impetuous\\u2014volcanic, I was about to say.\\nShe is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her\\nresolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name\\nwhich I have the honour to bear\\u201d\\u2014he gave a little stately cough\\u2014\\u201chad I\\nnot thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is\\ncapable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would\\nbe repugnant to her.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHave you her photograph?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI brought this with me.\\u201d He opened a locket and showed us the full\\nface of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory\\nminiature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the\\nlustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.\\nHolmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and\\nhanded it back to Lord St. Simon.\\n\\n\\u201cThe young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your\\nacquaintance?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met\\nher several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cShe brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cA fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait\\naccompli_?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI really have made no inquiries on the subject.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cVery naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the\\nwedding?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWas she in good spirits?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNever better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future\\nlives.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIndeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cShe was as bright as possible\\u2014at least until after the ceremony.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd did you observe any change in her then?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever\\nseen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was\\ntoo trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPray let us have it, for all that.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the\\nvestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over\\ninto the pew. There was a moment\\u2019s delay, but the gentleman in the pew\\nhanded it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for\\nthe fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me\\nabruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly\\nagitated over this trifling cause.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIndeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the\\ngeneral public were present, then?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThis gentleman was not one of your wife\\u2019s friends?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a\\ncommon-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I\\nthink that we are wandering rather far from the point.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cLady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful\\nframe of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering\\nher father\\u2019s house?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI saw her in conversation with her maid.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd who is her maid?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAlice is her name. She is an American and came from California with\\nher.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cA confidential servant?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cA little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to\\ntake great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these\\nthings in a different way.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow long did she speak to this Alice?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou did not overhear what they said?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cLady St. Simon said something about \\u2018jumping a claim.\\u2019 She was\\naccustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAmerican slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do\\nwhen she finished speaking to her maid?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cShe walked into the breakfast-room.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOn your arm?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then,\\nafter we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly,\\nmuttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came\\nback.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her\\nroom, covered her bride\\u2019s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet,\\nand went out.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cQuite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in\\ncompany with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had\\nalready made a disturbance at Mr. Doran\\u2019s house that morning.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and\\nyour relations to her.\\u201d\\n\\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. \\u201cWe have\\nbeen on a friendly footing for some years\\u2014I may say on a _very_\\nfriendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her\\nungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but\\nyou know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but\\nexceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me\\ndreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to\\ntell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly\\nwas that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came\\nto Mr. Doran\\u2019s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push\\nher way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even\\nthreatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the\\nsort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon\\npushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good\\nin making a row.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDid your wife hear all this?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, thank goodness, she did not.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so\\nserious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some\\nterrible trap for her.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, it is a possible supposition.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou think so, too?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this\\nas likely?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI do not think Flora would hurt a fly.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStill, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is\\nyour own theory as to what took place?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have\\ngiven you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it\\nhas occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the\\nconsciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the\\neffect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIn short, that she had become suddenly deranged?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, really, when I consider that she has turned her back\\u2014I will not\\nsay upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without\\nsuccess\\u2014I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,\\u201d said Holmes,\\nsmiling. \\u201cAnd now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my\\ndata. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that\\nyou could see out of the window?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe could see the other side of the road and the Park.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cQuite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I\\nshall communicate with you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cShould you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,\\u201d said our\\nclient, rising.\\n\\n\\u201cI have solved it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cEh? What was that?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI say that I have solved it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere, then, is my wife?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\\u201d\\n\\nLord St. Simon shook his head. \\u201cI am afraid that it will take wiser\\nheads than yours or mine,\\u201d he remarked, and bowing in a stately,\\nold-fashioned manner he departed.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a\\nlevel with his own,\\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \\u201cI think that I\\nshall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this\\ncross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before\\nour client came into the room.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy dear Holmes!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked\\nbefore, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn\\nmy conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally\\nvery convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote\\nThoreau\\u2019s example.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut I have heard all that you have heard.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWithout, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me\\nso well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and\\nsomething on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the\\nFranco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases\\u2014but, hullo, here is\\nLestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon\\nthe sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.\\u201d\\n\\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which\\ngave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas\\nbag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the\\ncigar which had been offered to him.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat\\u2019s up, then?\\u201d asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. \\u201cYou look\\ndissatisfied.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case.\\nI can make neither head nor tail of the business.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cReally! You surprise me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWho ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip\\nthrough my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd very wet it seems to have made you,\\u201d said Holmes laying his hand\\nupon the arm of the pea-jacket.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIn Heaven\\u2019s name, what for?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIn search of the body of Lady St. Simon.\\u201d\\n\\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\\n\\n\\u201cHave you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\n\\u201cWhy? What do you mean?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBecause you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one\\nas in the other.\\u201d\\n\\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. \\u201cI suppose you know all\\nabout it,\\u201d he snarled.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the\\nmatter?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI think it very unlikely.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in\\nit?\\u201d He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a\\nwedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a\\nbride\\u2019s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. \\u201cThere,\\u201d\\nsaid he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. \\u201cThere is\\na little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, indeed!\\u201d said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. \\u201cYou\\ndragged them from the Serpentine?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They\\nhave been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the\\nclothes were there the body would not be far off.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBy the same brilliant reasoning, every man\\u2019s body is to be found in\\nthe neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive\\nat through this?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAt some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI am afraid that you will find it difficult.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAre you, indeed, now?\\u201d cried Lestrade with some bitterness. \\u201cI am\\nafraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions\\nand your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes.\\nThis dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd how?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIn the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the\\ncard-case is a note. And here is the very note.\\u201d He slapped it down\\nupon the table in front of him. \\u201cListen to this: \\u2018You will see me when\\nall is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.\\u2019 Now my theory all along has been\\nthat Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she,\\nwith confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.\\nHere, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt\\nquietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within\\ntheir reach.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cVery good, Lestrade,\\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \\u201cYou really are very fine\\nindeed. Let me see it.\\u201d He took up the paper in a listless way, but his\\nattention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of\\nsatisfaction. \\u201cThis is indeed important,\\u201d said he.\\n\\n\\u201cHa! you find it so?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cExtremely so. I congratulate you warmly.\\u201d\\n\\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. \\u201cWhy,\\u201d he\\nshrieked, \\u201cyou\\u2019re looking at the wrong side!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOn the contrary, this is the right side.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe right side? You\\u2019re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over\\nhere.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill,\\nwhich interests me deeply.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing in it. I looked at it before,\\u201d said Lestrade. \\u201c\\u2018Oct.\\n4th, rooms 8_s_., breakfast 2_s_. 6_d_., cocktail 1_s_., lunch 2_s_.\\n6_d_., glass sherry, 8_d_.\\u2019 I see nothing in that.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cVery likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note,\\nit is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate\\nyou again.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ve wasted time enough,\\u201d said Lestrade, rising. \\u201cI believe in hard\\nwork and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day,\\nMr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter\\nfirst.\\u201d He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made\\nfor the door.\\n\\n\\u201cJust one hint to you, Lestrade,\\u201d drawled Holmes before his rival\\nvanished; \\u201cI will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St.\\nSimon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such\\nperson.\\u201d\\n\\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his\\nforehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\\n\\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his\\novercoat. \\u201cThere is something in what the fellow says about outdoor\\nwork,\\u201d he remarked, \\u201cso I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your\\npapers for a little.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was after five o\\u2019clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no\\ntime to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner\\u2019s\\nman with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a\\nyouth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great\\nastonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out\\nupon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of\\ncold woodcock, a pheasant, a _p\\u00e2t\\u00e9 de foie gras_ pie with a group of\\nancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my\\ntwo visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with\\nno explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered\\nto this address.\\n\\nJust before nine o\\u2019clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.\\nHis features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which\\nmade me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\\n\\n\\u201cThey have laid the supper, then,\\u201d he said, rubbing his hands.\\n\\n\\u201cYou seem to expect company. They have laid for five.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,\\u201d said he. \\u201cI am\\nsurprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that\\nI hear his step now upon the stairs.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,\\ndangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very\\nperturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\\n\\n\\u201cMy messenger reached you, then?\\u201d asked Holmes.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have\\nyou good authority for what you say?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe best possible.\\u201d\\n\\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat will the Duke say,\\u201d he murmured, \\u201cwhen he hears that one of the\\nfamily has been subjected to such humiliation?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any\\nhumiliation.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh, you look on these things from another standpoint.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady\\ncould have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was\\nundoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise\\nher at such a crisis.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt was a slight, sir, a public slight,\\u201d said Lord St. Simon, tapping\\nhis fingers upon the table.\\n\\n\\u201cYou must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented\\na position.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been\\nshamefully used.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI think that I heard a ring,\\u201d said Holmes. \\u201cYes, there are steps on\\nthe landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the\\nmatter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more\\nsuccessful.\\u201d He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.\\n\\u201cLord St. Simon,\\u201d said he \\u201callow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs.\\nFrancis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.\\u201d\\n\\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and\\nstood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the\\nbreast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had\\ntaken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he\\nstill refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution,\\nperhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re angry, Robert,\\u201d said she. \\u201cWell, I guess you have every cause\\nto be.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPray make no apology to me,\\u201d said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\\n\\n\\u201cOh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should\\nhave spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from\\nthe time when I saw Frank here again I just didn\\u2019t know what I was\\ndoing or saying. I only wonder I didn\\u2019t fall down and do a faint right\\nthere before the altar.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPerhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the\\nroom while you explain this matter?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIf I may give an opinion,\\u201d remarked the strange gentleman, \\u201cwe\\u2019ve had\\njust a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part,\\nI should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.\\u201d He was\\na small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert\\nmanner.\\n\\n\\u201cThen I\\u2019ll tell our story right away,\\u201d said the lady. \\u201cFrank here and I\\nmet in \\u201984, in McQuire\\u2019s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a\\nclaim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day\\nfather struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had\\na claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the\\npoorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn\\u2019t hear of our engagement lasting\\nany longer, and he took me away to \\u2019Frisco. Frank wouldn\\u2019t throw up his\\nhand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing\\nanything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just\\nfixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his\\npile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.\\nSo then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged\\nmyself not to marry anyone else while he lived. \\u2018Why shouldn\\u2019t we be\\nmarried right away, then,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018and then I will feel sure of you;\\nand I won\\u2019t claim to be your husband until I come back?\\u2019 Well, we\\ntalked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman\\nall ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank\\nwent off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.\\n\\n\\u201cThe next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went\\nprospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After\\nthat came a long newspaper story about how a miners\\u2019 camp had been\\nattacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank\\u2019s name among the\\nkilled. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa\\nthought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in \\u2019Frisco. Not\\na word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that\\nFrank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to \\u2019Frisco, and we came\\nto London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I\\nfelt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place\\nin my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\\n\\n\\u201cStill, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I\\u2019d have done my\\nduty by him. We can\\u2019t command our love, but we can our actions. I went\\nto the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a\\nwife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just\\nas I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and\\nlooking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at\\nfirst; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of\\nquestion in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to\\nsee him. I wonder I didn\\u2019t drop. I know that everything was turning\\nround, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee\\nin my ear. I didn\\u2019t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make\\na scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know\\nwhat I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to\\nbe still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that\\nhe was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped\\nmy bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he\\nreturned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when\\nhe made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment\\nthat my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever\\nhe might direct.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and\\nhad always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a\\nfew things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to\\nLord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all\\nthose great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain\\nafterwards. I hadn\\u2019t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank\\nout of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and\\nthen began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and\\nfollowed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St.\\nSimon to me\\u2014seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little\\nsecret of his own before marriage also\\u2014but I managed to get away from\\nher and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we\\ndrove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my\\ntrue wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a\\nprisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to \\u2019Frisco, found that\\nI had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there,\\nand had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI saw it in a paper,\\u201d explained the American. \\u201cIt gave the name and\\nthe church but not where the lady lived.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for\\nopenness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should\\nlike to vanish away and never see any of them again\\u2014just sending a line\\nto Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to\\nthink of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table\\nand waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and\\nthings and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and\\ndropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely\\nthat we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good\\ngentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he\\nfound us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and\\nkindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be\\nputting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to\\ngive us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came\\nright away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it\\nall, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you\\ndo not think very meanly of me.\\u201d\\n\\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had\\nlistened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long\\nnarrative.\\n\\n\\u201cExcuse me,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut it is not my custom to discuss my most\\nintimate personal affairs in this public manner.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen you won\\u2019t forgive me? You won\\u2019t shake hands before I go?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.\\u201d He put out his hand\\nand coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\\n\\n\\u201cI had hoped,\\u201d suggested Holmes, \\u201cthat you would have joined us in a\\nfriendly supper.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI think that there you ask a little too much,\\u201d responded his Lordship.\\n\\u201cI may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can\\nhardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your\\npermission I will now wish you all a very good-night.\\u201d He included us\\nall in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\\n\\n\\u201cThen I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,\\u201d said\\nSherlock Holmes. \\u201cIt is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton,\\nfor I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the\\nblundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our\\nchildren from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country\\nunder a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the\\nStars and Stripes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe case has been an interesting one,\\u201d remarked Holmes when our\\nvisitors had left us, \\u201cbecause it serves to show very clearly how\\nsimple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems\\nto be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the\\nsequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than\\nthe result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland\\nYard.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou were not yourself at fault at all, then?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFrom the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the\\nlady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other\\nthat she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.\\nObviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her\\nto change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have\\nspoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of\\nthe bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be\\nsomeone from America because she had spent so short a time in this\\ncountry that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an\\ninfluence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to\\nchange her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a\\nprocess of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American.\\nThen who could this American be, and why should he possess so much\\ninfluence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her\\nyoung womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under\\nstrange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.\\nSimon\\u2019s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in\\nthe bride\\u2019s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as\\nthe dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and\\nof her very significant allusion to claim-jumping\\u2014which in miners\\u2019\\nparlance means taking possession of that which another person has a\\nprior claim to\\u2014the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had\\ngone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous\\nhusband\\u2014the chances being in favour of the latter.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd how in the world did you find them?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in\\nhis hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials\\nwere, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was\\nit to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the\\nmost select London hotels.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow did you deduce the select?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBy the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a\\nglass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are\\nnot many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I\\nvisited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the\\nbook that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the\\nday before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon\\nthe very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were\\nto be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being\\nfortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give\\nthem some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be\\nbetter in every way that they should make their position a little\\nclearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.\\nI invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the\\nappointment.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut with no very good result,\\u201d I remarked. \\u201cHis conduct was certainly\\nnot very gracious.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAh, Watson,\\u201d said Holmes, smiling, \\u201cperhaps you would not be very\\ngracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you\\nfound yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think\\nthat we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars\\nthat we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw\\nyour chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still\\nto solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.\\u201d\",\n          \"A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA\\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him\\nmention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\\npredominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\\nakin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\\nwere abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\\nwas, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\\nthe world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\\nfalse position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\\nand a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer\\u2014excellent for\\ndrawing the veil from men\\u2019s motives and actions. But for the trained\\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\\nthrow a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\\nyet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\\nAdler, of dubious and questionable memory.\\n\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\\nfrom each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\\ninterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\\nwhile Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\\nsoul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\\nbooks, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\\nthe drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\\nnature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\\nand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\\nobservation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\\nmysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\\nFrom time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\\nsummons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\\nof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\\nhis activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\\n\\nOne night\\u2014it was on the twentieth of March, 1888\\u2014I was returning from a\\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\\nmy way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\\nwith the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\\nextraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\\nlooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\\nagainst the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\\nstory. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\\ndreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\\nand was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\\n\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\\nto see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\\nand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\\n\\n\\u201cWedlock suits you,\\u201d he remarked. \\u201cI think, Watson, that you have put\\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSeven!\\u201d I answered.\\n\\n\\u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\\nthat you intended to go into harness.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen, how do you know?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\\nservant girl?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy dear Holmes,\\u201d said I, \\u201cthis is too much. You would certainly have\\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\\ncountry walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\\nhave changed my clothes I can\\u2019t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out.\\u201d\\n\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is simplicity itself,\\u201d said he; \\u201cmy eyes tell me that on the inside\\nof your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\\nscored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\\norder to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\\ndeduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\\nto your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\\niodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\\nforefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\\u201d\\n\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\\nprocess of deduction. \\u201cWhen I hear you give your reasons,\\u201d I remarked,\\n\\u201cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\\nreasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cQuite so,\\u201d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\\ndown into an armchair. \\u201cYou see, but you do not observe. The\\ndistinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFrequently.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow often?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, some hundreds of times.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen how many are there?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow many? I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\\nmy point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\\nboth seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\\u201d He threw\\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\\nupon the table. \\u201cIt came by the last post,\\u201d said he. \\u201cRead it aloud.\\u201d\\n\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\n\\n\\u201cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\\u2019clock,\\u201d it\\nsaid, \\u201ca gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\\ndeepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\\nEurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\\nwear a mask.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThis is indeed a mystery,\\u201d I remarked. \\u201cWhat do you imagine that it\\nmeans?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\\ndata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\\ntheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\\nit?\\u201d\\n\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\\nwritten.\\n\\n\\u201cThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\\u201d I remarked,\\nendeavouring to imitate my companion\\u2019s processes. \\u201cSuch paper could not\\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\\nstiff.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPeculiar\\u2014that is the very word,\\u201d said Holmes. \\u201cIt is not an English\\npaper at all. Hold it up to the light.\\u201d\\n\\nI did so, and saw a large \\u201cE\\u201d with a small \\u201cg,\\u201d a \\u201cP,\\u201d and a large \\u201cG\\u201d\\nwith a small \\u201ct\\u201d woven into the texture of the paper.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat do you make of that?\\u201d asked Holmes.\\n\\n\\u201cThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNot at all. The \\u2018G\\u2019 with the small \\u2018t\\u2019 stands for \\u2018Gesellschaft,\\u2019\\nwhich is the German for \\u2018Company.\\u2019 It is a customary contraction like\\nour \\u2018Co.\\u2019 \\u2018P,\\u2019 of course, stands for \\u2018Papier.\\u2019 Now for the \\u2018Eg.\\u2019 Let us\\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.\\u201d He took down a heavy brown volume\\nfrom his shelves. \\u201cEglow, Eglonitz\\u2014here we are, Egria. It is in a\\nGerman-speaking country\\u2014in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \\u2018Remarkable\\nas being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\\nglass-factories and paper-mills.\\u2019 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\\nthat?\\u201d His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\\nfrom his cigarette.\\n\\n\\u201cThe paper was made in Bohemia,\\u201d I said.\\n\\n\\u201cPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\\npeculiar construction of the sentence\\u2014\\u2018This account of you we have from\\nall quarters received.\\u2019 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\\nthat. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\\nremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\\nwrites upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\\nface. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\\ndoubts.\\u201d\\n\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\\u2019 hoofs and grating\\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\\nwhistled.\\n\\n\\u201cA pair, by the sound,\\u201d said he. \\u201cYes,\\u201d he continued, glancing out of\\nthe window. \\u201cA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\\nand fifty guineas apiece. There\\u2019s money in this case, Watson, if there\\nis nothing else.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI think that I had better go, Holmes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\\nAnd this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut your client\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\\nSit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\\u201d\\n\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\\nauthoritative tap.\\n\\n\\u201cCome in!\\u201d said Holmes.\\n\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\\nin height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\\nwith a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\\ntaste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\\nfronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\\nthrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\\nsecured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\\nberyl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\\ntrimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\\nbarbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\\ncarried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\\nwas still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\\nhe appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\\nand a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\\nof obstinacy.\\n\\n\\u201cYou had my note?\\u201d he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\\nmarked German accent. \\u201cI told you that I would call.\\u201d He looked from\\none to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\n\\n\\u201cPray take a seat,\\u201d said Holmes. \\u201cThis is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\\nhave I the honour to address?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\\ndiscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\\nimportance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\\nalone.\\u201d\\n\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\\nmy chair. \\u201cIt is both, or none,\\u201d said he. \\u201cYou may say before this\\ngentleman anything which you may say to me.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \\u201cThen I must begin,\\u201d said he,\\n\\u201cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\\nmuch to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\\nEuropean history.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI promise,\\u201d said Holmes.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd I.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou will excuse this mask,\\u201d continued our strange visitor. \\u201cThe august\\nperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\\nconfess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\\nnot exactly my own.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI was aware of it,\\u201d said Holmes dryly.\\n\\n\\u201cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\\nbe taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\\nseriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\\nplainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\\nkings of Bohemia.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI was also aware of that,\\u201d murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\\nhis armchair and closing his eyes.\\n\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\\nmost incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\\n\\n\\u201cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\\u201d he remarked, \\u201cI\\nshould be better able to advise you.\\u201d\\n\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\\nthe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \\u201cYou are right,\\u201d\\nhe cried; \\u201cI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhy, indeed?\\u201d murmured Holmes. \\u201cYour Majesty had not spoken before I\\nwas aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\\nBohemia.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut you can understand,\\u201d said our strange visitor, sitting down once\\nmore and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \\u201cyou can\\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\\nperson. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\\nan agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_\\nfrom Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen, pray consult,\\u201d said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\n\\n\\u201cThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\\nvisit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,\\nIrene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\\u201d murmured Holmes without\\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\\nall paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to\\nname a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\\ninformation. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\\nthat of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\\nmonograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\\n\\n\\u201cLet me see!\\u201d said Holmes. \\u201cHum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.\\nContralto\\u2014hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw\\u2014yes!\\nRetired from operatic stage\\u2014ha! Living in London\\u2014quite so! Your\\nMajesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,\\nwrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting\\nthose letters back.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPrecisely so. But how\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWas there a secret marriage?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNone.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo legal papers or certificates?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNone.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should\\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\\nprove their authenticity?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThere is the writing.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPooh, pooh! Forgery.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy private note-paper.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStolen.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy own seal.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cImitated.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMy photograph.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBought.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe were both in the photograph.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\\nindiscretion.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI was mad\\u2014insane.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou have compromised yourself seriously.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt must be recovered.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe have tried and failed.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cShe will not sell.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStolen, then.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\\nhouse. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has\\nbeen waylaid. There has been no result.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo sign of it?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAbsolutely none.\\u201d\\n\\nHolmes laughed. \\u201cIt is quite a pretty little problem,\\u201d said he.\\n\\n\\u201cBut a very serious one to me,\\u201d returned the King reproachfully.\\n\\n\\u201cVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTo ruin me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut how?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI am about to be married.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSo I have heard.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is\\nherself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\\nwould bring the matter to an end.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd Irene Adler?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThreatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that\\nshe will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She\\nhas the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most\\nresolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no\\nlengths to which she would not go\\u2014none.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI am sure.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd why?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBecause she has said that she would send it on the day when the\\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, then we have three days yet,\\u201d said Holmes with a yawn. \\u201cThat is\\nvery fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into\\njust at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the\\npresent?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCertainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count\\nVon Kramm.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen, as to money?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou have _carte blanche_.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAbsolutely?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to\\nhave that photograph.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd for present expenses?\\u201d\\n\\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid\\nit on the table.\\n\\n\\u201cThere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\\u201d he\\nsaid.\\n\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it\\nto him.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd Mademoiselle\\u2019s address?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\n\\u201cIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\\u2019s Wood.\\u201d\\n\\nHolmes took a note of it. \\u201cOne other question,\\u201d said he. \\u201cWas the\\nphotograph a cabinet?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt was.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have\\nsome good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\\u201d he added, as the\\nwheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \\u201cIf you will be\\ngood enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o\\u2019clock I should like\\nto chat this little matter over with you.\\u201d\\n\\nAt three o\\u2019clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not\\nyet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house\\nshortly after eight o\\u2019clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire,\\nhowever, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.\\nI was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was\\nsurrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were\\nassociated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,\\nthe nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a\\ncharacter of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which\\nmade it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable\\nmysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very\\npossibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\\n\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my\\nfriend\\u2019s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three\\ntimes before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he\\nvanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\\ntweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his\\npockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed\\nheartily for some minutes.\\n\\n\\u201cWell, really!\\u201d he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he\\nwas obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed\\nmy morning, or what I ended by doing.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI can\\u2019t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\\nperhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cQuite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.\\nI left the house a little after eight o\\u2019clock this morning in the\\ncharacter of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and\\nfreemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all\\nthat there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_\\nvilla, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to\\nthe road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on\\nthe right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\\nand those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could\\nopen. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and\\nexamined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\\nanything else of interest.\\n\\n\\u201cI then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there\\nwas a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent\\nthe ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in\\nexchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,\\nand as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say\\nnothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was\\nnot in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to\\nlisten to.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd what of Irene Adler?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cOh, she has turned all the men\\u2019s heads down in that part. She is the\\ndaintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the\\nSerpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\\nout at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom\\ngoes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male\\nvisitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\\nnever calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey\\nNorton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a\\nconfidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,\\nand knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I\\nbegan to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think\\nover my plan of campaign.\\n\\n\\u201cThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.\\nHe was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between\\nthem, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,\\nhis friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably\\ntransferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less\\nlikely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should\\ncontinue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\\ngentleman\\u2019s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it\\nwidened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\\ndetails, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are\\nto understand the situation.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI am following you closely,\\u201d I answered.\\n\\n\\u201cI was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up\\nto Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably\\nhandsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached\\u2014evidently the man of whom\\nI had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman\\nto wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of\\na man who was thoroughly at home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of\\nhim in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking\\nexcitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently\\nhe emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to\\nthe cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it\\nearnestly, \\u2018Drive like the devil,\\u2019 he shouted, \\u2018first to Gross &\\nHankey\\u2019s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the\\nEdgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cAway they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well\\nto follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman\\nwith his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all\\nthe tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn\\u2019t\\npulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only\\ncaught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with\\na face that a man might die for.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018The Church of St. Monica, John,\\u2019 she cried, \\u2018and half a sovereign if\\nyou reach it in twenty minutes.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cThis was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether\\nI should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a\\ncab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby\\nfare, but I jumped in before he could object. \\u2018The Church of St.\\nMonica,\\u2019 said I, \\u2018and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty\\nminutes.\\u2019 It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was\\nclear enough what was in the wind.\\n\\n\\u201cMy cabby drove fast. I don\\u2019t think I ever drove faster, but the others\\nwere there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses\\nwere in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried\\ninto the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had\\nfollowed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with\\nthem. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I\\nlounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a\\nchurch. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\\nme, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Thank God,\\u2019 he cried. \\u2018You\\u2019ll do. Come! Come!\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018What then?\\u2019 I asked.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\\u2019t be legal.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cI was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I\\nfound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and\\nvouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in\\nthe secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,\\nbachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman\\nthanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the\\nclergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position\\nin which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it\\nthat started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some\\ninformality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused\\nto marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\\nappearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the\\nstreets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I\\nmean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThis is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\\u201d said I; \\u201cand what then?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the\\npair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt\\nand energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they\\nseparated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. \\u2018I\\nshall drive out in the park at five as usual,\\u2019 she said as she left\\nhim. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I\\nwent off to make my own arrangements.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhich are?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSome cold beef and a glass of beer,\\u201d he answered, ringing the bell. \\u201cI\\nhave been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still\\nthis evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI shall be delighted.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou don\\u2019t mind breaking the law?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNot in the least.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNor running a chance of arrest?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNot in a good cause.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, the cause is excellent!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen I am your man.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI was sure that I might rely on you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut what is it you wish?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhen Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.\\nNow,\\u201d he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our\\nlandlady had provided, \\u201cI must discuss it while I eat, for I have not\\nmuch time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene\\nof action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at\\nseven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd what then?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.\\nThere is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,\\ncome what may. You understand?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI am to be neutral?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTo do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed\\ninto the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window\\nwill open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd when I raise my hand\\u2014so\\u2014you will throw into the room what I give\\nyou to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You\\nquite follow me?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cEntirely.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt is nothing very formidable,\\u201d he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\\nroll from his pocket. \\u201cIt is an ordinary plumber\\u2019s smoke-rocket, fitted\\nwith a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is\\nconfined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up\\nby quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the\\nstreet, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made\\nmyself clear?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at\\nthe signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and\\nto wait you at the corner of the street.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPrecisely.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen you may entirely rely on me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare\\nfor the new role I have to play.\\u201d\\n\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the\\ncharacter of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His\\nbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic\\nsmile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such\\nas Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that\\nHolmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul\\nseemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a\\nfine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a\\nspecialist in crime.\\n\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\\nwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine\\nAvenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as\\nwe paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming\\nof its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from\\nSherlock Holmes\\u2019 succinct description, but the locality appeared to be\\nless private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a\\nquiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of\\nshabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\\nscissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a\\nnurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and\\ndown with cigars in their mouths.\\n\\n\\u201cYou see,\\u201d remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\\nhouse, \\u201cthis marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes\\na double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse\\nto its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming\\nto the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find\\nthe photograph?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere, indeed?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\\nsize. Too large for easy concealment about a woman\\u2019s dress. She knows\\nthat the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\\nattempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that\\nshe does not carry it about with her.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere, then?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHer banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\\ninclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like\\nto do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?\\nShe could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what\\nindirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\\nbusiness man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\\na few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be\\nin her own house.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut it has twice been burgled.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPshaw! They did not know how to look.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut how will you look?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI will not look.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat then?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI will get her to show me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut she will refuse.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cShe will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\\ncarriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\\u201d\\n\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the\\ncurve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\\nthe door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\\nthe corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\\ncopper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\\nthe same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\\nthe two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\\nscissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\\nstruck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\\nwas the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\\ndashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,\\nhe gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\\ndown his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\\ndirection and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\\ndressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\\ncrowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene\\nAdler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\\nstood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\\nthe hall, looking back into the street.\\n\\n\\u201cIs the poor gentleman much hurt?\\u201d she asked.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is dead,\\u201d cried several voices.\\n\\n\\u201cNo, no, there\\u2019s life in him!\\u201d shouted another. \\u201cBut he\\u2019ll be gone\\nbefore you can get him to hospital.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s a brave fellow,\\u201d said a woman. \\u201cThey would have had the lady\\u2019s\\npurse and watch if it hadn\\u2019t been for him. They were a gang, and a\\nrough one, too. Ah, he\\u2019s breathing now.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe can\\u2019t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSurely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\\nThis way, please!\\u201d\\n\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by\\nthe window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,\\nso that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know\\nwhether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he\\nwas playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\\nmyself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I\\nwas conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon\\nthe injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes\\nto draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened\\nmy heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I\\nthought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from\\ninjuring another.\\n\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\\nis in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\\nthe same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my\\nrocket into the room with a cry of \\u201cFire!\\u201d The word was no sooner out\\nof my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\\nill\\u2014gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids\\u2014joined in a general shriek of\\n\\u201cFire!\\u201d Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the\\nopen window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later\\nthe voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\\nalarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\\nof the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\\u2019s arm\\nin mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly\\nand in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the\\nquiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\\n\\n\\u201cYou did it very nicely, Doctor,\\u201d he remarked. \\u201cNothing could have been\\nbetter. It is all right.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou have the photograph?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI know where it is.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd how did you find out?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cShe showed me, as I told you she would.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI am still in the dark.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI do not wish to make a mystery,\\u201d said he, laughing. \\u201cThe matter was\\nperfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was\\nan accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI guessed as much.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\\npalm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\\nface, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat also I could fathom.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\\nshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\\nsuspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to\\nsee which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\\ncompelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHow did that help you?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\\nher instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\\nis a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\\nadvantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\\nwas of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\\nwoman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\\nNow it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\\nmore precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\\nsecure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\\nwere enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\\nphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\\nbell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\\nshe half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\\nreplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\\nnot seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\\nhouse. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\\nbut the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\\nseemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd now?\\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\\u201cOur quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\\nto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown\\ninto the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that\\nwhen she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be\\na satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd when will you call?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAt eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\\nclear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a\\ncomplete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without\\ndelay.\\u201d\\n\\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was\\nsearching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\\n\\n\\u201cGood-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\\u201d\\n\\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ve heard that voice before,\\u201d said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit\\nstreet. \\u201cNow, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\\u201d\\n\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast\\nand coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the\\nroom.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have really got it!\\u201d he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either\\nshoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\\n\\n\\u201cNot yet.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut you have hopes?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI have hopes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe must have a cab.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, my brougham is waiting.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen that will simplify matters.\\u201d We descended and started off once\\nmore for Briony Lodge.\\n\\n\\u201cIrene Adler is married,\\u201d remarked Holmes.\\n\\n\\u201cMarried! When?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYesterday.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut to whom?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTo an English lawyer named Norton.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut she could not love him.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI am in hopes that she does.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd why in hopes?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBecause it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If\\nthe lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does\\nnot love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with\\nyour Majesty\\u2019s plan.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt is true. And yet\\u2014! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!\\nWhat a queen she would have made!\\u201d He relapsed into a moody silence,\\nwhich was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\\n\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the\\nsteps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\\nbrougham.\\n\\n\\u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\\u201d said she.\\n\\n\\u201cI am Mr. Holmes,\\u201d answered my companion, looking at her with a\\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\\n\\n\\u201cIndeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left\\nthis morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for\\nthe Continent.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhat!\\u201d Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\\nsurprise. \\u201cDo you mean that she has left England?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNever to return.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd the papers?\\u201d asked the King hoarsely. \\u201cAll is lost.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe shall see.\\u201d He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\\ndrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was\\nscattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open\\ndrawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.\\nHolmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,\\nplunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The\\nphotograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was\\nsuperscribed to \\u201cSherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\\u201d My\\nfriend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at\\nmidnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\\n\\n    \\u201cMY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\\u2014You really did it very well. You took\\n    me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\\n    suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I\\n    began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had\\n    been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly\\n    be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you\\n    made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\\n    suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old\\n    clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.\\n    Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the\\n    freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,\\n    ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came\\n    down just as you departed.\\n\\n    \\u201cWell, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\\n    really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\\n    Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for\\n    the Temple to see my husband.\\n\\n    \\u201cWe both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so\\n    formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you\\n    call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in\\n    peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do\\n    what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly\\n    wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a\\n    weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\\n    take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to\\n    possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\n\\n\\n    \\u201cVery truly yours,\\n\\n    \\u201cIRENE NORTON, _n\\u00e9e_ ADLER.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\u201cWhat a woman\\u2014oh, what a woman!\\u201d cried the King of Bohemia, when we had\\nall three read this epistle. \\u201cDid I not tell you how quick and resolute\\nshe was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity\\nthat she was not on my level?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFrom what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very\\ndifferent level to your Majesty,\\u201d said Holmes coldly. \\u201cI am sorry that\\nI have not been able to bring your Majesty\\u2019s business to a more\\nsuccessful conclusion.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOn the contrary, my dear sir,\\u201d cried the King; \\u201cnothing could be more\\nsuccessful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as\\nsafe as if it were in the fire.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\\nyou. This ring\\u2014\\u201d He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and\\nheld it out upon the palm of his hand.\\n\\n\\u201cYour Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,\\u201d\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\\n\\u201cYou have but to name it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThis photograph!\\u201d\\n\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\n\\n\\u201cIrene\\u2019s photograph!\\u201d he cried. \\u201cCertainly, if you wish it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.\\nI have the honour to wish you a very good morning.\\u201d He bowed, and,\\nturning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched\\nout to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\\n\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\\nBohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a\\nwoman\\u2019s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I\\nhave not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or\\nwhen he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable\\ntitle of _the_ woman.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Watson, M.D.,\\n                      late of the Army Medical Department.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER I\\n          Mr. Sherlock Holmes\\n\\n\\n     In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\\n     University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the\\n     course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my\\n     studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland\\n     Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India\\n     at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had\\n     broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had\\n     advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's\\n     country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in\\n     the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in\\n     safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new\\n     duties.\\n\\n     The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\\n     nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade\\n     and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal\\n     battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail\\n     bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I\\n     should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not\\n     been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who\\n     threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to\\n     the British lines.\\n\\n     Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\\n     undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\\n     the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already\\n     improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to\\n     bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric\\n     fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was\\n     despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became\\n     convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board\\n     determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to\\n     England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship Orontes, and\\n     landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health\\n     irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government\\n     to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\\n\\n     I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\\n     air--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day\\n     will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally\\n     gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers\\n     and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for\\n     some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless,\\n     meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably\\n     more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances\\n     become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis\\n     and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a\\n     complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter\\n     alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to\\n     take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive\\n     domicile.\\n\\n     On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\\n     the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and\\n     turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser\\n     under me at Bart's. The sight of a friendly face in the great\\n     wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In\\n     old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now\\n     I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be\\n     delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to\\n     lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a\\n     hansom.\\n\\n     \\\"Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?\\\" he asked in\\n     undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\\n     \\\"You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.\\\"\\n\\n     I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded\\n     it by the time that we reached our destination.\\n\\n     \\\"Poor devil!\\\" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\\n     misfortunes. \\\"What are you up to now?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Looking for lodgings,\\\" I answered. \\\"Trying to solve the problem as\\n     to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable\\n     price.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"That's a strange thing,\\\" remarked my companion; \\\"you are the second\\n     man to-day that has used that expression to me.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And who was the first?\\\" I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the\\n     hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not\\n     get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had\\n     found, and which were too much for his purse.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"By Jove!\\\" I cried, \\\"if he really wants someone to share the rooms\\n     and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a\\n     partner to being alone.\\\"\\n\\n     Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass.\\n     \\\"You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet,\\\" he said; \\\"perhaps you would not\\n     care for him as a constant companion.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Why, what is there against him?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little\\n     queer in his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far\\n     as I know he is a decent fellow enough.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"A medical student, I suppose?\\\" said I.\\n\\n     \\\"No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is\\n     well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I\\n     know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His\\n     studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of\\n     out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Did you never ask him what he was going in for?\\\" I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\\n     communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I should like to meet him,\\\" I said. \\\"If I am to lodge with anyone, I\\n     should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\\n     enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\\n     Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\\n     could I meet this friend of yours?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"He is sure to be at the laboratory,\\\" returned my companion. \\\"He\\n     either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from\\n     morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after\\n     luncheon.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Certainly,\\\" I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\\n     channels.\\n\\n     As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn,\\n     Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I\\n     proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.\\n\\n     \\\"You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him,\\\" he said; \\\"I know\\n     nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally\\n     in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not\\n     hold me responsible.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"If we don't get on it will be easy to part company,\\\" I answered. \\\"It\\n     seems to me, Stamford,\\\" I added, looking hard at my companion, \\\"that\\n     you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this\\n     fellow's temper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealy-mouthed\\n     about it.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It is not easy to express the inexpressible,\\\" he answered with a\\n     laugh. \\\"Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it\\n     approaches to cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a\\n     little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of\\n     malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in\\n     order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I\\n     think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He\\n     appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Very right too.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the\\n     subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking\\n     rather a bizarre shape.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Beating the subjects!\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw\\n     him at it with my own eyes.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And yet you say he is not a medical student?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we\\n     are, and you must form your own impressions about him.\\\" As he spoke,\\n     we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door,\\n     which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar\\n     ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone\\n     staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of\\n     whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low\\n     arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical\\n     laboratory.\\n\\n     This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\\n     Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\\n     test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering\\n     flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over\\n     a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he\\n     glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \\\"I've\\n     found it! I've found it,\\\" he shouted to my companion, running towards\\n     us with a test-tube in his hand. \\\"I have found a re-agent which is\\n     precipitated by hoemoglobin, and by nothing else.\\\" Had he discovered\\n     a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.\\n\\n     \\\"Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\\" said Stamford, introducing us.\\n\\n     \\\"How are you?\\\" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength\\n     for which I should hardly have given him credit. \\\"You have been in\\n     Afghanistan, I perceive.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"How on earth did you know that?\\\" I asked in astonishment.\\n\\n     \\\"Never mind,\\\" said he, chuckling to himself. \\\"The question now is\\n     about hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this\\n     discovery of mine?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\\\" I answered, \\\"but\\n     practically--\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\\n     Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.\\n     Come over here now!\\\" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his\\n     eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been\\n     working. \\\"Let us have some fresh blood,\\\" he said, digging a long\\n     bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood\\n     in a chemical pipette. \\\"Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a\\n     litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the\\n     appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than\\n     one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to\\n     obtain the characteristic reaction.\\\" As he spoke, he threw into the\\n     vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a\\n     transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany\\n     colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the\\n     glass jar.\\n\\n     \\\"Ha! ha!\\\" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\\n     child with a new toy. \\\"What do you think of that?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It seems to be a very delicate test,\\\" I remarked.\\n\\n     \\\"Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\\n     uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles.\\n     The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this\\n     appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test\\n     been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who\\n     would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Indeed!\\\" I murmured.\\n\\n     \\\"Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\\n     suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\\n     linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon\\n     them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit\\n     stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many\\n     an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have\\n     the Sherlock Holmes' test, and there will no longer be any\\n     difficulty.\\\"\\n\\n     His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\\n     heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\\n     imagination.\\n\\n     \\\"You are to be congratulated,\\\" I remarked, considerably surprised at\\n     his enthusiasm.\\n\\n     \\\"There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\\n     certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there\\n     was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of\\n     Montpellier, and Samson of new Orleans. I could name a score of cases\\n     in which it would have been decisive.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,\\\" said Stamford with a\\n     laugh. \\\"You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the 'Police\\n     News of the Past.'\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Very interesting reading it might be made, too,\\\" remarked Sherlock\\n     Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his\\n     finger. \\\"I have to be careful,\\\" he continued, turning to me with a\\n     smile, \\\"for I dabble with poisons a good deal.\\\" He held out his hand\\n     as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar\\n     pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.\\n\\n     \\\"We came here on business,\\\" said Stamford, sitting down on a high\\n     three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his\\n     foot. \\\"My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were\\n     complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I\\n     thought that I had better bring you together.\\\"\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms\\n     with me. \\\"I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,\\\" he said, \\\"which\\n     would suit us down to the ground. You don't mind the smell of strong\\n     tobacco, I hope?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I always smoke 'ship's' myself,\\\" I answered.\\n\\n     \\\"That's good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and\\n     occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"By no means.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at\\n     times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I\\n     am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right.\\n     What have you to confess now? It's just as well for two fellows to\\n     know the worst of one another before they begin to live together.\\\"\\n\\n     I laughed at this cross-examination. \\\"I keep a bull pup,\\\" I said,\\n     \\\"and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at\\n     all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another\\n     set of vices when I'm well, but those are the principal ones at\\n     present.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?\\\" he asked,\\n     anxiously.\\n\\n     \\\"It depends on the player,\\\" I answered. \\\"A well-played violin is a\\n     treat for the gods--a badly-played one--\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Oh, that's all right,\\\" he cried, with a merry laugh. \\\"I think we may\\n     consider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\\n     you.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"When shall we see them?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle\\n     everything,\\\" he answered.\\n\\n     \\\"All right--noon exactly,\\\" said I, shaking his hand.\\n\\n     We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together\\n     towards my hotel.\\n\\n     \\\"By the way,\\\" I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,\\n     \\\"how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?\\\"\\n\\n     My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. \\\"That's just his little\\n     peculiarity,\\\" he said. \\\"A good many people have wanted to know how he\\n     finds things out.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Oh! a mystery is it?\\\" I cried, rubbing my hands. \\\"This is very\\n     piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. 'The\\n     proper study of mankind is man,' you know.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You must study him, then,\\\" Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\\n     \\\"You'll find him a knotty problem, though. I'll wager he learns more\\n     about you than you about him. Good-bye.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Good-bye,\\\" I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably\\n     interested in my new acquaintance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER II\\n          The Science Of Deduction\\n\\n\\n     We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.\\n     221b, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\\n     consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large\\n     airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\\n     windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so\\n     moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain\\n     was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.\\n     That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\\n     following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\\n     portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking\\n     and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we\\n     gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our\\n     new surroundings.\\n\\n     Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet\\n     in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be\\n     up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\\n     before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the\\n     chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and\\n     occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the\\n     lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the\\n     working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize\\n     him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the\\n     sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning\\n     to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant\\n     expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being\\n     addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and\\n     cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.\\n\\n     As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\\n     aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\\n     appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\\n     observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\\n     lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp\\n     and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have\\n     alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an\\n     air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and\\n     squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were\\n     invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was\\n     possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had\\n     occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile\\n     philosophical instruments.\\n\\n     The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\\n     much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to\\n     break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\\n     himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\\n     objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my\\n     attention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather\\n     was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me\\n     and break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these\\n     circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around\\n     my companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel\\n     it.\\n\\n     He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\\n     confirmed Stamford's opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear\\n     to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a\\n     degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him\\n     an entrance into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies\\n     was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so\\n     extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly\\n     astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise\\n     information unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory\\n     readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No\\n     man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good\\n     reason for doing so.\\n\\n     His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\\n     literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to\\n     nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest\\n     way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a\\n     climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of\\n     the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System.\\n     That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not\\n     be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me\\n     such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.\\n\\n     \\\"You appear to be astonished,\\\" he said, smiling at my expression of\\n     surprise. \\\"Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"To forget it!\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You see,\\\" he explained, \\\"I consider that a man's brain originally is\\n     like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such\\n     furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort\\n     that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to\\n     him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other\\n     things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now\\n     the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into\\n     his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help\\n     him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and\\n     all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that\\n     little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend\\n     upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you\\n     forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest\\n     importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the\\n     useful ones.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"But the Solar System!\\\" I protested.\\n\\n     \\\"What the deuce is it to me?\\\" he interrupted impatiently; \\\"you say\\n     that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make\\n     a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.\\\"\\n\\n     I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but\\n     something in his manner showed me that the question would be an\\n     unwelcome one. I pondered over our short conversation, however, and\\n     endeavoured to draw my deductions from it. He said that he would\\n     acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object. Therefore\\n     all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to\\n     him. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he\\n     had shown me that he was exceptionally well-informed. I even took a\\n     pencil and jotted them down. I could not help smiling at the document\\n     when I had completed it. It ran in this way--\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes--his limits.\\n     \\n     1. Knowledge of Literature.--Nil.\\n     2. Philosophy.--Nil.\\n     3. Astronomy.--Nil.\\n     4. Politics.--Feeble.\\n     5. Botany.--Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons\\n     generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.\\n     6. Geology.--Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different\\n     soils from each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his\\n     trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of\\n     London he had received them.\\n     7. Chemistry.--Profound.\\n     8. Anatomy.--Accurate, but unsystematic.\\n     9. Sensational Literature.--Immense. He appears to know every detail\\n     of every horror perpetrated in the century.\\n     10. Plays the violin well.\\n     11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.\\n     12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\\n\\n     When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.\\n     \\\"If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all\\n     these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them\\n     all,\\\" I said to myself, \\\"I may as well give up the attempt at once.\\\"\\n\\n     I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These\\n     were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other\\n     accomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I\\n     knew well, because at my request he has played me some of\\n     Mendelssohn's Lieder, and other favourites. When left to himself,\\n     however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized\\n     air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his\\n     eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his\\n     knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally\\n     they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts\\n     which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or\\n     whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more\\n     than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these\\n     exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by\\n     playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a\\n     slight compensation for the trial upon my patience.\\n\\n     During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to\\n     think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself.\\n     Presently, however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those\\n     in the most different classes of society. There was one little sallow\\n     rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade,\\n     and who came three or four times in a single week. One morning a\\n     young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour\\n     or more. The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor,\\n     looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and\\n     who was closely followed by a slipshod elderly woman. On another\\n     occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my\\n     companion; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform.\\n     When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance,\\n     Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I\\n     would retire to my bed-room. He always apologized to me for putting\\n     me to this inconvenience. \\\"I have to use this room as a place of\\n     business,\\\" he said, \\\"and these people are my clients.\\\" Again I had an\\n     opportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my\\n     delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I\\n     imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding\\n     to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject\\n     of his own accord.\\n\\n     It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that\\n     I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes\\n     had not yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so\\n     accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my\\n     coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang\\n     the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked\\n     up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time\\n     with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the\\n     articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to\\n     run my eye through it.\\n\\n     Its somewhat ambitious title was \\\"The Book of Life,\\\" and it attempted\\n     to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and\\n     systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as\\n     being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The\\n     reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to\\n     be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary\\n     expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a\\n     man's inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility\\n     in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His\\n     conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So\\n     startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they\\n     learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well\\n     consider him as a necromancer.\\n\\n     \\\"From a drop of water,\\\" said the writer, \\\"a logician could infer the\\n     possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard\\n     of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of\\n     which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all\\n     other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can\\n     only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to\\n     allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it.\\n     Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which\\n     present the greatest difficulties, let the enquirer begin by\\n     mastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a\\n     fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the\\n     man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such\\n     an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and\\n     teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man's finger\\n     nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser knees, by the\\n     callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his\\n     shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man's calling is plainly\\n     revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent\\n     enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What ineffable twaddle!\\\" I cried, slapping the magazine down on the\\n     table, \\\"I never read such rubbish in my life.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What is it?\\\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n     \\\"Why, this article,\\\" I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I\\n     sat down to my breakfast. \\\"I see that you have read it since you have\\n     marked it. I don't deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me\\n     though. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who\\n     evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own\\n     study. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in\\n     a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the\\n     trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one\\n     against him.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You would lose your money,\\\" Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly.  \\\"As\\n     for the article I wrote it myself.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You!\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\\n     theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be\\n     so chimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I\\n     depend upon them for my bread and cheese.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And how?\\\" I asked involuntarily.\\n\\n     \\\"Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\\n     world. I'm a consulting detective, if you can understand what that\\n     is. Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of\\n     private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I\\n     manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence\\n     before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of\\n     the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family\\n     resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a\\n     thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can't unravel the\\n     thousand and first. Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got\\n     himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what\\n     brought him here.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And these other people?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all\\n     people who are in trouble about something, and want a little\\n     enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments,\\n     and then I pocket my fee.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"But do you mean to say,\\\" I said, \\\"that without leaving your room you\\n     can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although\\n     they have seen every detail for themselves?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\\n     turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about\\n     and see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special\\n     knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters\\n     wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which\\n     aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work.\\n     Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised\\n     when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from\\n     Afghanistan.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You were told, no doubt.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Nothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. From long\\n     habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I\\n     arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate\\n     steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran,\\n     'Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a\\n     military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the\\n     tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of\\n     his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and\\n     sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been\\n     injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the\\n     tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got\\n     his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.' The whole train of thought\\n     did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you came from\\n     Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It is simple enough as you explain it,\\\" I said, smiling. \\\"You remind\\n     me of Edgar Allen Poe's Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals\\n     did exist outside of stories.\\\"\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. \\\"No doubt you think that you\\n     are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,\\\" he observed. \\\"Now, in\\n     my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of\\n     breaking in on his friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a\\n     quarter of an hour's silence is really very showy and superficial. He\\n     had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a\\n     phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Have you read Gaboriau's works?\\\" I asked. \\\"Does Lecoq come up to\\n     your idea of a detective?\\\"\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. \\\"Lecoq was a miserable\\n     bungler,\\\" he said, in an angry voice; \\\"he had only one thing to\\n     recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively\\n     ill. The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could\\n     have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It\\n     might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to\\n     avoid.\\\"\\n\\n     I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired\\n     treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and\\n     stood looking out into the busy street. \\\"This fellow may be very\\n     clever,\\\" I said to myself, \\\"but he is certainly very conceited.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,\\\" he said,\\n     querulously. \\\"What is the use of having brains in our profession? I\\n     know well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives\\n     or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of\\n     natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what\\n     is the result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some\\n     bungling villany with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland\\n     Yard official can see through it.\\\"\\n\\n     I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought\\n     it best to change the topic.\\n\\n     \\\"I wonder what that fellow is looking for?\\\" I asked, pointing to a\\n     stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the\\n     other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a\\n     large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a\\n     message.\\n\\n     \\\"You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,\\\" said Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n     \\\"Brag and bounce!\\\" thought I to myself. \\\"He knows that I cannot\\n     verify his guess.\\\"\\n\\n     The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we\\n     were watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly\\n     across the roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and\\n     heavy steps ascending the stair.\\n\\n     \\\"For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\\" he said, stepping into the room and\\n     handing my friend the letter.\\n\\n     Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little\\n     thought of this when he made that random shot. \\\"May I ask, my lad,\\\" I\\n     said, in the blandest voice, \\\"what your trade may be?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Commissionaire, sir,\\\" he said, gruffly. \\\"Uniform away for repairs.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And you were?\\\" I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my\\n     companion.\\n\\n     \\\"A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,\\n     sir.\\\"\\n\\n     He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was\\n     gone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER III\\n          The Lauriston Garden Mystery\\n\\n\\n     I confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the\\n     practical nature of my companion's theories. My respect for his\\n     powers of analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some\\n     lurking suspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a\\n     pre-arranged episode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly\\n     object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension. When\\n     I looked at him he had finished reading the note, and his eyes had\\n     assumed the vacant, lack-lustre expression which showed mental\\n     abstraction.\\n\\n     \\\"How in the world did you deduce that?\\\" I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"Deduce what?\\\" said he, petulantly.\\n\\n     \\\"Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I have no time for trifles,\\\" he answered, brusquely; then with a\\n     smile, \\\"Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but\\n     perhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that\\n     man was a sergeant of Marines?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"No, indeed.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were\\n     asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some\\n     difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the\\n     street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the\\n     fellow's hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,\\n     however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He\\n     was a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of\\n     command. You must have observed the way in which he held his head and\\n     swung his cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the\\n     face of him--all facts which led me to believe that he had been a\\n     sergeant.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Wonderful!\\\" I ejaculated.\\n\\n     \\\"Commonplace,\\\" said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that\\n     he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. \\\"I said just\\n     now that there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong--look at\\n     this!\\\" He threw me over the note which the commissionaire had\\n     brought.\\n\\n     \\\"Why,\\\" I cried, as I cast my eye over it, \\\"this is terrible!\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It does seem to be a little out of the common,\\\" he remarked, calmly.\\n     \\\"Would you mind reading it to me aloud?\\\"\\n\\n     This is the letter which I read to him--\\n\\n     \\\"My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes:\\n     \\\"There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston\\n     Gardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there\\n     about two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one,\\n     suspected that something was amiss. He found the door open, and in\\n     the front room, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a\\n     gentleman, well dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the\\n     name of 'Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.' There had been no\\n     robbery, nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death.\\n     There are marks of blood in the room, but there is no wound upon his\\n     person. We are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house;\\n     indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler. If you can come round to the\\n     house any time before twelve, you will find me there. I have left\\n     everything in statu quo until I hear from you. If you are unable to\\n     come I shall give you fuller details, and would esteem it a great\\n     kindness if you would favour me with your opinion.\\n     \\\"Yours faithfully,\\n     \\\"Tobias Gregson.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\\\" my friend\\n     remarked; \\\"he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both\\n     quick and energetic, but conventional--shockingly so. They have their\\n     knives into one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of\\n     professional beauties. There will be some fun over this case if they\\n     are both put upon the scent.\\\"\\n\\n     I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. \\\"Surely there is\\n     not a moment to be lost,\\\" I cried, \\\"shall I go and order you a cab?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I'm not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy\\n     devil that ever stood in shoe leather--that is, when the fit is on\\n     me, for I can be spry enough at times.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the\\n     whole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will\\n     pocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"But he begs you to help him.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but\\n     he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third\\n     person. However, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it\\n     out on my own hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing\\n     else. Come on!\\\"\\n\\n     He hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed\\n     that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.\\n\\n     \\\"Get your hat,\\\" he said.\\n\\n     \\\"You wish me to come?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes, if you have nothing better to do.\\\" A minute later we were both\\n     in a hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.\\n\\n     It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the\\n     house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets\\n     beneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away\\n     about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and\\n     an Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the\\n     melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.\\n\\n     \\\"You don't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\\\" I said\\n     at last, interrupting Holmes' musical disquisition.\\n\\n     \\\"No data yet,\\\" he answered. \\\"It is a capital mistake to theorize\\n     before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You will have your data soon,\\\" I remarked, pointing with my finger;\\n     \\\"this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very\\n     much mistaken.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"So it is. Stop, driver, stop!\\\" We were still a hundred yards or so\\n     from it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our\\n     journey upon foot.\\n\\n     Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It\\n     was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two\\n     being occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers\\n     of vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that\\n     here and there a \\\"To Let\\\" card had developed like a cataract upon the\\n     bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered\\n     eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the\\n     street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour,\\n     and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The\\n     whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through\\n     the night. The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a\\n     fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning\\n     a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers,\\n     who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of\\n     catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.\\n\\n     I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into\\n     the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared\\n     to be further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which,\\n     under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he\\n     lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground,\\n     the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings. Having\\n     finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather\\n     down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes\\n     riveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile,\\n     and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many\\n     marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had\\n     been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion\\n     could hope to learn anything from it. Still I had had such\\n     extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties,\\n     that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden\\n     from me.\\n\\n     At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,\\n     flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward\\n     and wrung my companion's hand with effusion. \\\"It is indeed kind of\\n     you to come,\\\" he said, \\\"I have had everything left untouched.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Except that!\\\" my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \\\"If a\\n     herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess.\\n     No doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson,\\n     before you permitted this.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I have had so much to do inside the house,\\\" the detective said\\n     evasively. \\\"My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon\\n     him to look after this.\\\"\\n\\n     Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. \\\"With two\\n     such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\\n     much for a third party to find out,\\\" he said.\\n\\n     Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. \\\"I think we have\\n     done all that can be done,\\\" he answered; \\\"it's a queer case though,\\n     and I knew your taste for such things.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You did not come here in a cab?\\\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n     \\\"No, sir.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Nor Lestrade?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"No, sir.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Then let us go and look at the room.\\\" With which inconsequent remark\\n     he strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features\\n     expressed his astonishment.\\n\\n     A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and\\n     offices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One\\n     of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged\\n     to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious\\n     affair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that\\n     subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.\\n\\n     It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence\\n     of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it\\n     was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips\\n     had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster\\n     beneath. Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a\\n     mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner of this was\\n     stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty\\n     that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to\\n     everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which\\n     coated the whole apartment.\\n\\n     All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\\n     centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched\\n     upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the\\n     discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or\\n     forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp\\n     curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a\\n     heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured\\n     trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed\\n     and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were\\n     clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were\\n     interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On\\n     his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed\\n     to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This\\n     malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead,\\n     blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly\\n     simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing,\\n     unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it\\n     appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\\n     apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\\n     London.\\n\\n     Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway,\\n     and greeted my companion and myself.\\n\\n     \\\"This case will make a stir, sir,\\\" he remarked. \\\"It beats anything I\\n     have seen, and I am no chicken.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"There is no clue?\\\" said Gregson.\\n\\n     \\\"None at all,\\\" chimed in Lestrade.\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\\n     intently. \\\"You are sure that there is no wound?\\\" he asked, pointing\\n     to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\\n\\n     \\\"Positive!\\\" cried both detectives.\\n\\n     \\\"Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second\\n     individual--presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It\\n     reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen,\\n     in Utrecht, in the year '34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"No, sir.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Read it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun.\\n     It has all been done before.\\\"\\n\\n     As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and\\n     everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes\\n     wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon.\\n     So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have\\n     guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he\\n     sniffed the dead man's lips, and then glanced at the soles of his\\n     patent leather boots.\\n\\n     \\\"He has not been moved at all?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n     \\\"No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You can take him to the mortuary now,\\\" he said. \\\"There is nothing\\n     more to be learned.\\\"\\n\\n     Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they\\n     entered the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As\\n     they raised him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor.\\n     Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\\n\\n     \\\"There's been a woman here,\\\" he cried. \\\"It's a woman's wedding-ring.\\\"\\n\\n     He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all\\n     gathered round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that\\n     circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\\n\\n     \\\"This complicates matters,\\\" said Gregson. \\\"Heaven knows, they were\\n     complicated enough before.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You're sure it doesn't simplify them?\\\" observed Holmes. \\\"There's\\n     nothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\\n     pockets?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"We have it all here,\\\" said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects\\n     upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. \\\"A gold watch, No. 97163,\\n     by Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold\\n     ring, with masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog's head, with rubies as\\n     eyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of\\n     Cleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse,\\n     but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket\\n     edition of Boccaccio's 'Decameron,' with name of Joseph Stangerson\\n     upon the fly-leaf. Two letters--one addressed to E. J. Drebber and\\n     one to Joseph Stangerson.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"At what address?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"American Exchange, Strand--to be left till called for. They are both\\n     from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their\\n     boats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about\\n     to return to New York.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I did it at once, sir,\\\" said Gregson. \\\"I have had advertisements\\n     sent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the\\n     American Exchange, but he has not returned yet.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Have you sent to Cleveland?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"We telegraphed this morning.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"How did you word your inquiries?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be\\n     glad of any information which could help us.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you\\n     to be crucial?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I asked about Stangerson.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case\\n     appears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I have said all I have to say,\\\" said Gregson, in an offended voice.\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make\\n     some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we\\n     were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the\\n     scene, rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.\\n\\n     \\\"Mr. Gregson,\\\" he said, \\\"I have just made a discovery of the highest\\n     importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a\\n     careful examination of the walls.\\\"\\n\\n     The little man's eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a\\n     state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his\\n     colleague.\\n\\n     \\\"Come here,\\\" he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of\\n     which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. \\\"Now,\\n     stand there!\\\"\\n\\n     He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\\n\\n     \\\"Look at that!\\\" he said, triumphantly.\\n\\n     I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this\\n     particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a\\n     yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was\\n     scrawled in blood-red letters a single word--\\n\\n                                     RACHE.\\n\\n     \\\"What do you think of that?\\\" cried the detective, with the air of a\\n     showman exhibiting his show. \\\"This was overlooked because it was in\\n     the darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there.\\n     The murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear\\n     where it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of\\n     suicide anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will\\n     tell you. See that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time,\\n     and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the\\n     darkest portion of the wall.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And what does it mean now that you have found it?\\\" asked Gregson in\\n     a depreciatory voice.\\n\\n     \\\"Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name\\n     Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You\\n     mark my words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find\\n     that a woman named Rachel has something to do with it. It's all very\\n     well for you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and\\n     clever, but the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I really beg your pardon!\\\" said my companion, who had ruffled the\\n     little man's temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. \\\"You\\n     certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,\\n     and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the\\n     other participant in last night's mystery. I have not had time to\\n     examine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.\\\"\\n\\n     As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying\\n     glass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted\\n     noiselessly about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally\\n     kneeling, and once lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with\\n     his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for\\n     he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time, keeping\\n     up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries\\n     suggestive of encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was\\n     irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it\\n     dashes backwards and forwards through the covert, whining in its\\n     eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent. For twenty minutes\\n     or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact\\n     care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me,\\n     and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally\\n     incomprehensible manner. In one place he gathered up very carefully a\\n     little pile of grey dust from the floor, and packed it away in an\\n     envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass the word upon the wall,\\n     going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness. This\\n     done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he replaced his tape and his\\n     glass in his pocket.\\n\\n     \\\"They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\\\" he\\n     remarked with a smile. \\\"It's a very bad definition, but it does apply\\n     to detective work.\\\"\\n\\n     Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres of their amateur\\n     companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They\\n     evidently failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to\\n     realize, that Sherlock Holmes' smallest actions were all directed\\n     towards some definite and practical end.\\n\\n     \\\"What do you think of it, sir?\\\" they both asked.\\n\\n     \\\"It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to\\n     presume to help you,\\\" remarked my friend. \\\"You are doing so well now\\n     that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere.\\\" There was a world\\n     of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke. \\\"If you will let me know how\\n     your investigations go,\\\" he continued, \\\"I shall be happy to give you\\n     any help I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the\\n     constable who found the body. Can you give me his name and address?\\\"\\n\\n     Lestrade glanced at his note-book. \\\"John Rance,\\\" he said. \\\"He is off\\n     duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park\\n     Gate.\\\"\\n\\n     Holmes took a note of the address.\\n\\n     \\\"Come along, Doctor,\\\" he said; \\\"we shall go and look him up. I'll\\n     tell you one thing which may help you in the case,\\\" he continued,\\n     turning to the two detectives. \\\"There has been murder done, and the\\n     murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime\\n     of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed\\n     boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim\\n     in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old\\n     shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all probability the\\n     murderer had a florid face, and the finger-nails of his right hand\\n     were remarkably long. These are only a few indications, but they may\\n     assist you.\\\"\\n\\n     Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\\n\\n     \\\"If this man was murdered, how was it done?\\\" asked the former.\\n\\n     \\\"Poison,\\\" said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. \\\"One other\\n     thing, Lestrade,\\\" he added, turning round at the door: \\\"'Rache,' is\\n     the German for 'revenge;' so don't lose your time looking for Miss\\n     Rachel.\\\"\\n\\n     With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals\\n     open-mouthed behind him. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER IV\\n          What John Rance Had To Tell\\n\\n\\n     It was one o'clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock\\n     Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\\n     long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take\\n     us to the address given us by Lestrade.\\n\\n     \\\"There is nothing like first hand evidence,\\\" he remarked; \\\"as a\\n     matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still\\n     we may as well learn all that is to be learned.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You amaze me, Holmes,\\\" said I. \\\"Surely you are not as sure as you\\n     pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"There's no room for a mistake,\\\" he answered. \\\"The very first thing\\n     which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts\\n     with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had\\n     no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep\\n     impression must have been there during the night. There were the\\n     marks of the horse's hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far\\n     more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was\\n     a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not\\n     there at any time during the morning--I have Gregson's word for\\n     that--it follows that it must have been there during the night, and,\\n     therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"That seems simple enough,\\\" said I; \\\"but how about the other man's\\n     height?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\\n     the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\\n     there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow's\\n     stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a\\n     way of checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his\\n     instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that\\n     writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child's play.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And his age?\\\" I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\\n     effort, he can't be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the\\n     breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked\\n     across. Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had\\n     hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply\\n     applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and\\n     deduction which I advocated in that article. Is there anything else\\n     that puzzles you?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\\\" I suggested.\\n\\n     \\\"The writing on the wall was done with a man's forefinger dipped in\\n     blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\\n     scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the\\n     man's nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from\\n     the floor. It was dark in colour and flakey--such an ash as is only\\n     made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar\\n     ashes--in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. I\\n     flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any\\n     known brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such\\n     details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and\\n     Lestrade type.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And the florid face?\\\" I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was\\n     right. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.\\\"\\n\\n     I passed my hand over my brow. \\\"My head is in a whirl,\\\" I remarked;\\n     \\\"the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came\\n     these two men--if there were two men--into an empty house? What has\\n     become of the cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another\\n     to take poison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of\\n     the murderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman's\\n     ring there? Above all, why should the second man write up the German\\n     word RACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible\\n     way of reconciling all these facts.\\\"\\n\\n     My companion smiled approvingly.\\n\\n     \\\"You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\\\"\\n     he said. \\\"There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite\\n     made up my mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade's discovery it\\n     was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by\\n     suggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a\\n     German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German\\n     fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character,\\n     so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a\\n     clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert\\n     inquiry into a wrong channel. I'm not going to tell you much more of\\n     the case, Doctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has\\n     explained his trick, and if I show you too much of my method of\\n     working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary\\n     individual after all.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I shall never do that,\\\" I answered; \\\"you have brought detection as\\n     near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.\\\"\\n\\n     My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest\\n     way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as\\n     sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of\\n     her beauty.\\n\\n     \\\"I'll tell you one other thing,\\\" he said. \\\"Patent-leathers and\\n     Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway\\n     together as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability.\\n     When they got inside they walked up and down the room--or rather,\\n     Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I\\n     could read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked\\n     he grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length\\n     of his strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up,\\n     no doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I've told you all I\\n     know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have\\n     a good working basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up,\\n     for I want to go to Halle's concert to hear Norman Neruda this\\n     afternoon.\\\"\\n\\n     This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its\\n     way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In\\n     the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a\\n     stand. \\\"That's Audley Court in there,\\\" he said, pointing to a narrow\\n     slit in the line of dead-coloured brick. \\\"You'll find me here when\\n     you come back.\\\"\\n\\n     Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led\\n     us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings.\\n     We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines\\n     of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which\\n     was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was\\n     engraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we\\n     were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.\\n\\n     He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed\\n     in his slumbers. \\\"I made my report at the office,\\\" he said.\\n\\n     Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it\\n     pensively. \\\"We thought that we should like to hear it all from your\\n     own lips,\\\" he said.\\n\\n     \\\"I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,\\\" the constable\\n     answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.\\n\\n     \\\"Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.\\\"\\n\\n     Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though\\n     determined not to omit anything in his narrative.\\n\\n     \\\"I'll tell it ye from the beginning,\\\" he said. \\\"My time is from ten\\n     at night to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the\\n     'White Hart'; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one\\n     o'clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the\\n     Holland Grove beat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta\\n     Street a-talkin'. Presently--maybe about two or a little after--I\\n     thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the\\n     Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet\\n     all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin'\\n     down, thinkin' between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot\\n     would be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the\\n     window of that same house. Now, I knew that them two houses in\\n     Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who\\n     won't have the drains seed to, though the very last tenant what lived\\n     in one of them died o' typhoid fever. I was knocked all in a heap\\n     therefore at seeing a light in the window, and I suspected as\\n     something was wrong. When I got to the door--\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,\\\" my companion\\n     interrupted. \\\"What did you do that for?\\\"\\n\\n     Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the\\n     utmost amazement upon his features.\\n\\n     \\\"Why, that's true, sir,\\\" he said; \\\"though how you come to know it,\\n     Heaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still\\n     and so lonesome, that I thought I'd be none the worse for some one\\n     with me. I ain't afeared of anything on this side o' the grave; but I\\n     thought that maybe it was him that died o' the typhoid inspecting the\\n     drains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o' turn, and I\\n     walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher's lantern, but\\n     there wasn't no sign of him nor of anyone else.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"There was no one in the street?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Not a livin' soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\\n     together and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet\\n     inside, so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin'. There\\n     was a candle flickerin' on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its\\n     light I saw--\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several\\n     times, and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through\\n     and tried the kitchen door, and then--\\\"\\n\\n     John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in\\n     his eyes. \\\"Where was you hid to see all that?\\\" he cried. \\\"It seems to\\n     me that you knows a deal more than you should.\\\"\\n\\n     Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.\\n     \\\"Don't get arresting me for the murder,\\\" he said. \\\"I am one of the\\n     hounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for\\n     that. Go on, though. What did you do next?\\\"\\n\\n     Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified\\n     expression. \\\"I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That\\n     brought Murcher and two more to the spot.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Was the street empty then?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What do you mean?\\\"\\n\\n     The constable's features broadened into a grin. \\\"I've seen many a\\n     drunk chap in my time,\\\" he said, \\\"but never anyone so cryin' drunk as\\n     that cove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin' up ag'in the\\n     railings, and a-singin' at the pitch o' his lungs about Columbine's\\n     New-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn't stand, far less\\n     help.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What sort of a man was he?\\\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n     John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. \\\"He\\n     was an uncommon drunk sort o' man,\\\" he said. \\\"He'd ha' found hisself\\n     in the station if we hadn't been so took up.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"His face--his dress--didn't you notice them?\\\" Holmes broke in\\n     impatiently.\\n\\n     \\\"I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him\\n     up--me and Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face,\\n     the lower part muffled round--\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"That will do,\\\" cried Holmes. \\\"What became of him?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"We'd enough to do without lookin' after him,\\\" the policeman said, in\\n     an aggrieved voice. \\\"I'll wager he found his way home all right.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"How was he dressed?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"A brown overcoat.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Had he a whip in his hand?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"A whip--no.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"He must have left it behind,\\\" muttered my companion. \\\"You didn't\\n     happen to see or hear a cab after that?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"There's a half-sovereign for you,\\\" my companion said, standing up\\n     and taking his hat. \\\"I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in\\n     the force. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament.\\n     You might have gained your sergeant's stripes last night. The man\\n     whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this\\n     mystery, and whom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it\\n     now; I tell you that it is so. Come along, Doctor.\\\"\\n\\n     We started off for the cab together, leaving our informant\\n     incredulous, but obviously uncomfortable.\\n\\n     \\\"The blundering fool,\\\" Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our\\n     lodgings. \\\"Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of\\n     good luck, and not taking advantage of it.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of\\n     this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery.\\n     But why should he come back to the house after leaving it? That is\\n     not the way of criminals.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have\\n     no other way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the\\n     ring. I shall have him, Doctor--I'll lay you two to one that I have\\n     him. I must thank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you,\\n     and so have missed the finest study I ever came across: a study in\\n     scarlet, eh? Why shouldn't we use a little art jargon. There's the\\n     scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of\\n     life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every\\n     inch of it. And now for lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack\\n     and her bowing are splendid. What's that little thing of Chopin's she\\n     plays so magnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.\\\"\\n\\n     Leaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a\\n     lark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER V\\n          Our Advertisement Brings A Visitor\\n\\n\\n     Our morning's exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I\\n     was tired out in the afternoon. After Holmes' departure for the\\n     concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of\\n     hours' sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much\\n     excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and\\n     surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw\\n     before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man.\\n     So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me\\n     that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who\\n     had removed its owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke\\n     vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch\\n     J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be\\n     done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the\\n     eyes of the law.\\n\\n     The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion's\\n     hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how\\n     he had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected\\n     something which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not\\n     poison, what had caused the man's death, since there was neither\\n     wound nor marks of strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood\\n     was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of\\n     a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have\\n     wounded an antagonist. As long as all these questions were unsolved,\\n     I felt that sleep would be no easy matter, either for Holmes or\\n     myself. His quiet self-confident manner convinced me that he had\\n     already formed a theory which explained all the facts, though what it\\n     was I could not for an instant conjecture.\\n\\n     He was very late in returning--so late, that I knew that the concert\\n     could not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table\\n     before he appeared.\\n\\n     \\\"It was magnificent,\\\" he said, as he took his seat. \\\"Do you remember\\n     what Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing\\n     and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the\\n     power of speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly\\n     influenced by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those\\n     misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"That's rather a broad idea,\\\" I remarked.\\n\\n     \\\"One's ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret\\n     Nature,\\\" he answered. \\\"What's the matter? You're not looking quite\\n     yourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"To tell the truth, it has,\\\" I said. \\\"I ought to be more\\n     case-hardened after my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades\\n     hacked to pieces at Maiwand without losing my nerve.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\\n     imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have\\n     you seen the evening paper?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention\\n     the fact that when the man was raised up, a woman's wedding ring fell\\n     upon the floor. It is just as well it does not.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Why?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Look at this advertisement,\\\" he answered. \\\"I had one sent to every\\n     paper this morning immediately after the affair.\\\"\\n\\n     He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated.\\n     It was the first announcement in the \\\"Found\\\" column. \\\"In Brixton\\n     Road, this morning,\\\" it ran, \\\"a plain gold wedding ring, found in the\\n     roadway between the 'White Hart' Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr.\\n     Watson, 221b, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Excuse my using your name,\\\" he said. \\\"If I used my own some of these\\n     dunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"That is all right,\\\" I answered. \\\"But supposing anyone applies, I\\n     have no ring.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Oh yes, you have,\\\" said he, handing me one. \\\"This will do very well.\\n     It is almost a facsimile.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Why, the man in the brown coat--our florid friend with the square\\n     toes. If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Would he not consider it as too dangerous?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every\\n     reason to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything\\n     than lose the ring. According to my notion he dropped it while\\n     stooping over Drebber's body, and did not miss it at the time. After\\n     leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found\\n     the police already in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving\\n     the candle burning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay\\n     the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the\\n     gate. Now put yourself in that man's place. On thinking the matter\\n     over, it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had\\n     lost the ring in the road after leaving the house. What would he do,\\n     then? He would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of\\n     seeing it among the articles found. His eye, of course, would light\\n     upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There\\n     would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be\\n     connected with the murder. He would come. He will come. You shall see\\n     him within an hour.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And then?\\\" I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and\\n     though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for\\n     anything.\\\"\\n\\n     I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with\\n     the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his\\n     favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.\\n\\n     \\\"The plot thickens,\\\" he said, as I entered; \\\"I have just had an\\n     answer to my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct\\n     one.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And that is?\\\" I asked eagerly.\\n\\n     \\\"My fiddle would be the better for new strings,\\\" he remarked. \\\"Put\\n     your pistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an\\n     ordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don't frighten him by looking at\\n     him too hard.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It is eight o'clock now,\\\" I said, glancing at my watch.\\n\\n     \\\"Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door\\n     slightly. That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you!\\n     This is a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday--De Jure\\n     inter Gentes--published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642.\\n     Charles' head was still firm on his shoulders when this little\\n     brown-backed volume was struck off.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Who is the printer?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very\\n     faded ink, is written 'Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.' I wonder who\\n     William Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I\\n     suppose. His writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man,\\n     I think.\\\"\\n\\n     As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose\\n     softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the\\n     servant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she\\n     opened it.\\n\\n     \\\"Does Dr. Watson live here?\\\" asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We\\n     could not hear the servant's reply, but the door closed, and some one\\n     began to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and\\n     shuffling one. A look of surprise passed over the face of my\\n     companion as he listened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and\\n     there was a feeble tap at the door.\\n\\n     \\\"Come in,\\\" I cried.\\n\\n     At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a\\n     very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared\\n     to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a\\n     curtsey, she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling\\n     in her pocket with nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion,\\n     and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was\\n     all I could do to keep my countenance.\\n\\n     The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our\\n     advertisement. \\\"It's this as has brought me, good gentlemen,\\\" she\\n     said, dropping another curtsey; \\\"a gold wedding ring in the Brixton\\n     Road. It belongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time\\n     twelvemonth, which her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and\\n     what he'd say if he comes 'ome and found her without her ring is more\\n     than I can think, he being short enough at the best o' times, but\\n     more especially when he has the drink. If it please you, she went to\\n     the circus last night along with--\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Is that her ring?\\\" I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"The Lord be thanked!\\\" cried the old woman; \\\"Sally will be a glad\\n     woman this night. That's the ring.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And what may your address be?\\\" I inquired, taking up a pencil.\\n\\n     \\\"13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,\\\"\\n     said Sherlock Holmes sharply.\\n\\n     The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little\\n     red-rimmed eyes. \\\"The gentleman asked me for my address,\\\" she said.\\n     \\\"Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And your name is--?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"My name is Sawyer--her's is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married\\n     her--and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he's at sea, and no\\n     steward in the company more thought of; but when on shore, what with\\n     the women and what with liquor shops--\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,\\\" I interrupted, in obedience to a\\n     sign from my companion; \\\"it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I\\n     am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner.\\\"\\n\\n     With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old\\n     crone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs.\\n     Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and\\n     rushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an\\n     ulster and a cravat. \\\"I'll follow her,\\\" he said, hurriedly; \\\"she must\\n     be an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.\\\" The hall\\n     door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had\\n     descended the stair. Looking through the window I could see her\\n     walking feebly along the other side, while her pursuer dogged her\\n     some little distance behind. \\\"Either his whole theory is incorrect,\\\"\\n     I thought to myself, \\\"or else he will be led now to the heart of the\\n     mystery.\\\" There was no need for him to ask me to wait up for him, for\\n     I felt that sleep was impossible until I heard the result of his\\n     adventure.\\n\\n     It was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he\\n     might be, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the\\n     pages of Henri Murger's Vie de Boh\\u00e8me. Ten o'clock passed, and I\\n     heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven,\\n     and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for\\n     the same destination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the\\n     sharp sound of his latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his\\n     face that he had not been successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to\\n     be struggling for the mastery, until the former suddenly carried the\\n     day, and he burst into a hearty laugh.\\n\\n     \\\"I wouldn't have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,\\\" he\\n     cried, dropping into his chair; \\\"I have chaffed them so much that\\n     they would never have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to\\n     laugh, because I know that I will be even with them in the long run.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What is it then?\\\" I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"Oh, I don't mind telling a story against myself. That creature had\\n     gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being\\n     foot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler\\n     which was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the\\n     address, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out\\n     loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street, 'Drive to\\n     13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch,' she cried. This begins to look\\n     genuine, I thought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched\\n     myself behind. That's an art which every detective should be an\\n     expert at. Well, away we rattled, and never drew rein until we\\n     reached the street in question. I hopped off before we came to the\\n     door, and strolled down the street in an easy, lounging way. I saw\\n     the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and I saw him open the door\\n     and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. When I reached him he\\n     was groping about frantically in the empty cab, and giving vent to\\n     the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to.\\n     There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear it will be\\n     some time before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Number 13 we found\\n     that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named Keswick,\\n     and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been\\n     heard of there.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You don't mean to say,\\\" I cried, in amazement, \\\"that that tottering,\\n     feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in\\n     motion, without either you or the driver seeing her?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Old woman be damned!\\\" said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. \\\"We were the\\n     old women to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an\\n     active one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was\\n     inimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this\\n     means of giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is\\n     not as lonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to\\n     risk something for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my\\n     advice and turn in.\\\"\\n\\n     I was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I\\n     left Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into\\n     the watches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his\\n     violin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem\\n     which he had set himself to unravel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER VI\\n          Tobias Gregson Shows What He Can Do\\n\\n\\n     The papers next day were full of the \\\"Brixton Mystery,\\\" as they\\n     termed it. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had\\n     leaders upon it in addition. There was some information in them which\\n     was new to me. I still retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and\\n     extracts bearing upon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of\\n     them:--\\n\\n     The Daily Telegraph remarked that in the history of crime there had\\n     seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German\\n     name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister\\n     inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political\\n     refugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in\\n     America, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten\\n     laws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the\\n     Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers,\\n     the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff\\n     Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government\\n     and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.\\n\\n     The Standard commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the\\n     sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from\\n     the unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent\\n     weakening of all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman\\n     who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed\\n     at the boarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace,\\n     Camberwell. He was accompanied in his travels by his private\\n     secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The two bade adieu to their\\n     landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to Euston Station\\n     with the avowed intention of catching the Liverpool express. They\\n     were afterwards seen together upon the platform. Nothing more is\\n     known of them until Mr. Drebber's body was, as recorded, discovered\\n     in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many miles from Euston. How he\\n     came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are still\\n     involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the whereabouts of\\n     Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson,\\n     of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it is\\n     confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily\\n     throw light upon the matter.\\n\\n     The Daily News observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being\\n     a political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which\\n     animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to\\n     our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens\\n     were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had\\n     undergone. Among these men there was a stringent code of honour, any\\n     infringement of which was punished by death. Every effort should be\\n     made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to ascertain some\\n     particulars of the habits of the deceased. A great step had been\\n     gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had\\n     boarded--a result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy\\n     of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast,\\n     and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.\\n\\n     \\\"I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be\\n     sure to score.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"That depends on how it turns out.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Oh, bless you, it doesn't matter in the least. If the man is caught,\\n     it will be on account of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be\\n     in spite of their exertions. It's heads I win and tails you lose.\\n     Whatever they do, they will have followers. 'Un sot trouve toujours\\n     un plus sot qui l'admire.'\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What on earth is this?\\\" I cried, for at this moment there came the\\n     pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by\\n     audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.\\n\\n     \\\"It's the Baker Street division of the detective police force,\\\" said\\n     my companion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room\\n     half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I\\n     clapped eyes on.\\n\\n     \\\"'Tention!\\\" cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little\\n     scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. \\\"In\\n     future you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you\\n     must wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"No, sir, we hain't,\\\" said one of the youths.\\n\\n     \\\"I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are\\n     your wages.\\\" He handed each of them a shilling. \\\"Now, off you go, and\\n     come back with a better report next time.\\\"\\n\\n     He waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many\\n     rats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.\\n\\n     \\\"There's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than\\n     out of a dozen of the force,\\\" Holmes remarked. \\\"The mere sight of an\\n     official-looking person seals men's lips. These youngsters, however,\\n     go everywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too;\\n     all they want is organisation.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?\\\" I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a\\n     matter of time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a\\n     vengeance! Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude\\n     written upon every feature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he\\n     is stopping. There he is!\\\"\\n\\n     There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the\\n     fair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and\\n     burst into our sitting-room.\\n\\n     \\\"My dear fellow,\\\" he cried, wringing Holmes' unresponsive hand,\\n     \\\"congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.\\\"\\n\\n     A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion's expressive\\n     face.\\n\\n     \\\"Do you mean that you are on the right track?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n     \\\"The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And his name is?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty's navy,\\\" cried\\n     Gregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.\\n\\n     \\\"Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,\\\" he said. \\\"We are anxious\\n     to know how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I don't mind if I do,\\\" the detective answered. \\\"The tremendous\\n     exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have\\n     worn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the\\n     strain upon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\n     for we are both brain-workers.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You do me too much honour,\\\" said Holmes, gravely. \\\"Let us hear how\\n     you arrived at this most gratifying result.\\\"\\n\\n     The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed\\n     complacently at his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a\\n     paroxysm of amusement.\\n\\n     \\\"The fun of it is,\\\" he cried, \\\"that that fool Lestrade, who thinks\\n     himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is\\n     after the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime\\n     than the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this\\n     time.\\\"\\n\\n     The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.\\n\\n     \\\"And how did you get your clue?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Ah, I'll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is\\n     strictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to\\n     contend with was the finding of this American's antecedents. Some\\n     people would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or\\n     until parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not\\n     Tobias Gregson's way of going to work. You remember the hat beside\\n     the dead man?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes,\\\" said Holmes; \\\"by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell\\n     Road.\\\"\\n\\n     Gregson looked quite crest-fallen.\\n\\n     \\\"I had no idea that you noticed that,\\\" he said. \\\"Have you been\\n     there?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Ha!\\\" cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; \\\"you should never neglect a\\n     chance, however small it may seem.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"To a great mind, nothing is little,\\\" remarked Holmes, sententiously.\\n\\n     \\\"Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of\\n     that size and description. He looked over his books, and came on it\\n     at once. He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at\\n     Charpentier's Boarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at\\n     his address.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Smart--very smart!\\\" murmured Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n     \\\"I next called upon Madame Charpentier,\\\" continued the detective. \\\"I\\n     found her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room,\\n     too--an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about\\n     the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn't escape\\n     my notice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock\\n     Holmes, when you come upon the right scent--a kind of thrill in your\\n     nerves. 'Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder\\n     Mr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?' I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"The mother nodded. She didn't seem able to get out a word. The\\n     daughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people\\n     knew something of the matter.\\n\\n     \\\"'At what o'clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?' I\\n     asked.\\n\\n     \\\"'At eight o'clock,' she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her\\n     agitation. 'His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two\\n     trains--one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.'\\n\\n     \\\"'And was that the last which you saw of him?'\\n\\n     \\\"A terrible change came over the woman's face as I asked the\\n     question. Her features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds\\n     before she could get out the single word 'Yes'--and when it did come\\n     it was in a husky unnatural tone.\\n\\n     \\\"There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a\\n     calm clear voice.\\n\\n     \\\"'No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,' she said. 'Let us be\\n     frank with this gentleman. We did see Mr. Drebber again.'\\n\\n     \\\"'God forgive you!' cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands\\n     and sinking back in her chair. 'You have murdered your brother.'\\n\\n     \\\"'Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,' the girl answered\\n     firmly.\\n\\n     \\\"'You had best tell me all about it now,' I said. 'Half-confidences\\n     are worse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of\\n     it.'\\n\\n     \\\"'On your head be it, Alice!' cried her mother; and then, turning to\\n     me, 'I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on\\n     behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand\\n     in this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is,\\n     however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to\\n     be compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high\\n     character, his profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.'\\n\\n     \\\"'Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,' I answered.\\n     'Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.'\\n\\n     \\\"'Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,' she said, and\\n     her daughter withdrew. 'Now, sir,' she continued, 'I had no intention\\n     of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it\\n     I have no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you\\n     all without omitting any particular.'\\n\\n     \\\"'It is your wisest course,' said I.\\n\\n     \\\"'Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his\\n     secretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I\\n     noticed a \\\"Copenhagen\\\" label upon each of their trunks, showing that\\n     that had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet\\n     reserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.\\n     He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night\\n     of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed,\\n     after twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be\\n     sober. His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free\\n     and familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude\\n     towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way\\n     which, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one\\n     occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her--an\\n     outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his\\n     unmanly conduct.'\\n\\n     \\\"'But why did you stand all this,' I asked. 'I suppose that you can\\n     get rid of your boarders when you wish.'\\n\\n     \\\"Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. 'Would to God\\n     that I had given him notice on the very day that he came,' she said.\\n     'But it was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day\\n     each--fourteen pounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a\\n     widow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the\\n     money. I acted for the best. This last was too much, however, and I\\n     gave him notice to leave on account of it. That was the reason of his\\n     going.'\\n\\n     \\\"'Well?'\\n\\n     \\\"'My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave\\n     just now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper\\n     is violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed\\n     the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas,\\n     in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that\\n     Mr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the\\n     worse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting\\n     with my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed\\n     his train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed\\n     to her that she should fly with him. \\\"You are of age,\\\" he said, \\\"and\\n     there is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never\\n     mind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You\\n     shall live like a princess.\\\" Poor Alice was so frightened that she\\n     shrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured\\n     to draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son\\n     Arthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard\\n     oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to\\n     raise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the\\n     doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. \\\"I don't think that fine\\n     fellow will trouble us again,\\\" he said. \\\"I will just go after him and\\n     see what he does with himself.\\\" With those words he took his hat and\\n     started off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr.\\n     Drebber's mysterious death.'\\n\\n     \\\"This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier's lips with many gasps and\\n     pauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the\\n     words. I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that\\n     there should be no possibility of a mistake.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It's quite exciting,\\\" said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \\\"What\\n     happened next?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"When Mrs. Charpentier paused,\\\" the detective continued, \\\"I saw that\\n     the whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way\\n     which I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour\\n     her son returned.\\n\\n     \\\"'I do not know,' she answered.\\n\\n     \\\"'Not know?'\\n\\n     \\\"'No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.'\\n\\n     \\\"'After you went to bed?'\\n\\n     \\\"'Yes.'\\n\\n     \\\"'When did you go to bed?'\\n\\n     \\\"'About eleven.'\\n\\n     \\\"'So your son was gone at least two hours?'\\n\\n     \\\"'Yes.'\\n\\n     \\\"'Possibly four or five?'\\n\\n     \\\"'Yes.'\\n\\n     \\\"'What was he doing during that time?'\\n\\n     \\\"'I do not know,' she answered, turning white to her very lips.\\n\\n     \\\"Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out\\n     where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and\\n     arrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to\\n     come quietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, 'I suppose you\\n     are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel\\n     Drebber,' he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his\\n     alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Very,\\\" said Holmes.\\n\\n     \\\"He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as\\n     having with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What is your theory, then?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton\\n     Road. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the\\n     course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of\\n     the stomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The\\n     night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the\\n     body of his victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the\\n     blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so\\n     many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Well done!\\\" said Holmes in an encouraging voice. \\\"Really, Gregson,\\n     you are getting along. We shall make something of you yet.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,\\\" the\\n     detective answered proudly. \\\"The young man volunteered a statement,\\n     in which he said that after following Drebber some time, the latter\\n     perceived him, and took a cab in order to get away from him. On his\\n     way home he met an old shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On\\n     being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any\\n     satisfactory reply. I think the whole case fits together uncommonly\\n     well. What amuses me is to think of Lestrade, who had started off\\n     upon the wrong scent. I am afraid he won't make much of--Why, by\\n     Jove, here's the very man himself!\\\"\\n\\n     It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were\\n     talking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness\\n     which generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however,\\n     wanting. His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were\\n     disarranged and untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of\\n     consulting with Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he\\n     appeared to be embarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the\\n     room, fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. \\\"This\\n     is a most extraordinary case,\\\" he said at last--\\\"a most\\n     incomprehensible affair.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!\\\" cried Gregson, triumphantly. \\\"I\\n     thought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find\\n     the Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,\\\" said Lestrade gravely, \\\"was\\n     murdered at Halliday's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning.\\\"\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER VII\\n          Light In The Darkness\\n\\n\\n     The intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and\\n     so unexpected, that we were all three fairly dumbfounded. Gregson\\n     sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and\\n     water. I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were\\n     compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes.\\n\\n     \\\"Stangerson too!\\\" he muttered. \\\"The plot thickens.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It was quite thick enough before,\\\" grumbled Lestrade, taking a\\n     chair. \\\"I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Are you--are you sure of this piece of intelligence?\\\" stammered\\n     Gregson.\\n\\n     \\\"I have just come from his room,\\\" said Lestrade. \\\"I was the first to\\n     discover what had occurred.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"We have been hearing Gregson's view of the matter,\\\" Holmes observed.\\n     \\\"Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I have no objection,\\\" Lestrade answered, seating himself. \\\"I freely\\n     confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in\\n     the death of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was\\n     completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out\\n     what had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at\\n     Euston Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At\\n     two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The\\n     question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been\\n     employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become\\n     of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description\\n     of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats.\\n     I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in\\n     the vicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his\\n     companion had become separated, the natural course for the latter\\n     would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then\\n     to hang about the station again next morning.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,\\\"\\n     remarked Holmes.\\n\\n     \\\"So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making\\n     enquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early,\\n     and at eight o'clock I reached Halliday's Private Hotel, in Little\\n     George Street. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was\\n     living there, they at once answered me in the affirmative.\\n\\n     \\\"'No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,' they said.\\n     'He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days.'\\n\\n     \\\"'Where is he now?' I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"'He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.'\\n\\n     \\\"'I will go up and see him at once,' I said.\\n\\n     \\\"It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and\\n     lead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me\\n     the room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor\\n     leading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about\\n     to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel\\n     sickish, in spite of my twenty years' experience. From under the door\\n     there curled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across\\n     the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other\\n     side. I gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted\\n     when he saw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our\\n     shoulders to it, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open,\\n     and beside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his\\n     nightdress. He was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his\\n     limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned him over, the Boots\\n     recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged\\n     the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause of death was\\n     a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart.\\n     And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose\\n     was above the murdered man?\\\"\\n\\n     I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,\\n     even before Sherlock Holmes answered.\\n\\n     \\\"The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\\\" he said.\\n\\n     \\\"That was it,\\\" said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all\\n     silent for a while.\\n\\n     There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the\\n     deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness\\n     to his crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of\\n     battle tingled as I thought of it.\\n\\n     \\\"The man was seen,\\\" continued Lestrade. \\\"A milk boy, passing on his\\n     way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the\\n     mews at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which\\n     usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the\\n     second floor, which was wide open. After passing, he looked back and\\n     saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that\\n     the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the\\n     hotel. He took no particular notice of him, beyond thinking in his\\n     own mind that it was early for him to be at work. He has an\\n     impression that the man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed\\n     in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in the room some little\\n     time after the murder, for we found blood-stained water in the basin,\\n     where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had\\n     deliberately wiped his knife.\\\"\\n\\n     I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which\\n     tallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of\\n     exultation or satisfaction upon his face.\\n\\n     \\\"Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the\\n     murderer?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n     \\\"Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber's purse in his pocket, but it seems\\n     that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd\\n     pounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of\\n     these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them.\\n     There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man's pocket,\\n     except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and\\n     containing the words, 'J. H. is in Europe.' There was no name\\n     appended to this message.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And there was nothing else?\\\" Holmes asked.\\n\\n     \\\"Nothing of any importance. The man's novel, with which he had read\\n     himself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair\\n     beside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the\\n     window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.\\\"\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.\\n\\n     \\\"The last link,\\\" he cried, exultantly. \\\"My case is complete.\\\"\\n\\n     The two detectives stared at him in amazement.\\n\\n     \\\"I have now in my hands,\\\" my companion said, confidently, \\\"all the\\n     threads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course,\\n     details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts,\\n     from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up\\n     to the discovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them\\n     with my own eyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you\\n     lay your hand upon those pills?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I have them,\\\" said Lestrade, producing a small white box; \\\"I took\\n     them and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a\\n     place of safety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my\\n     taking these pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any\\n     importance to them.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Give them here,\\\" said Holmes. \\\"Now, Doctor,\\\" turning to me, \\\"are\\n     those ordinary pills?\\\"\\n\\n     They certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,\\n     round, and almost transparent against the light. \\\"From their\\n     lightness and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in\\n     water,\\\" I remarked.\\n\\n     \\\"Precisely so,\\\" answered Holmes. \\\"Now would you mind going down and\\n     fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so\\n     long, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain\\n     yesterday.\\\"\\n\\n     I went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms. It's\\n     laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from\\n     its end. Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already\\n     exceeded the usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a\\n     cushion on the rug.\\n\\n     \\\"I will now cut one of these pills in two,\\\" said Holmes, and drawing\\n     his penknife he suited the action to the word. \\\"One half we return\\n     into the box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this\\n     wine glass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our\\n     friend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"This may be very interesting,\\\" said Lestrade, in the injured tone of\\n     one who suspects that he is being laughed at, \\\"I cannot see, however,\\n     what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has\\n     everything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the\\n     mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he\\n     laps it up readily enough.\\\"\\n\\n     As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer\\n     and placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry.\\n     Sherlock Holmes' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we\\n     all sat in silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some\\n     startling effect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to\\n     lie stretched upon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but\\n     apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught.\\n\\n     Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without\\n     result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment\\n     appeared upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers\\n     upon the table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience.\\n     So great was his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while\\n     the two detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this\\n     check which he had met.\\n\\n     \\\"It can't be a coincidence,\\\" he cried, at last springing from his\\n     chair and pacing wildly up and down the room; \\\"it is impossible that\\n     it should be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in\\n     the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson.\\n     And yet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of\\n     reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this\\n     wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!\\\" With a\\n     perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in\\n     two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The\\n     unfortunate creature's tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in\\n     it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid\\n     and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from\\n     his forehead. \\\"I should have more faith,\\\" he said; \\\"I ought to know\\n     by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train\\n     of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some\\n     other interpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the\\n     most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to\\n     have known that before ever I saw the box at all.\\\"\\n\\n     This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could\\n     hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead\\n     dog, however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It\\n     seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing\\n     away, and I began to have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\\n\\n     \\\"All this seems strange to you,\\\" continued Holmes, \\\"because you\\n     failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the\\n     single real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune\\n     to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has\\n     served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the\\n     logical sequence of it. Hence things which have perplexed you and\\n     made the case more obscure, have served to enlighten me and to\\n     strengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake to confound strangeness\\n     with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious\\n     because it presents no new or special features from which deductions\\n     may be drawn. This murder would have been infinitely more difficult\\n     to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the\\n     roadway without any of those outr\\u00e9 and sensational accompaniments\\n     which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from\\n     making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making\\n     it less so.\\\"\\n\\n     Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable\\n     impatience, could contain himself no longer. \\\"Look here, Mr. Sherlock\\n     Holmes,\\\" he said, \\\"we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a\\n     smart man, and that you have your own methods of working. We want\\n     something more than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a\\n     case of taking the man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was\\n     wrong. Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second\\n     affair. Lestrade went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that\\n     he was wrong too. You have thrown out hints here, and hints there,\\n     and seem to know more than we do, but the time has come when we feel\\n     that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the\\n     business. Can you name the man who did it?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,\\\" remarked\\n     Lestrade. \\\"We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have\\n     remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had\\n     all the evidence which you require. Surely you will not withhold it\\n     any longer.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Any delay in arresting the assassin,\\\" I observed, \\\"might give him\\n     time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity.\\\"\\n\\n     Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He\\n     continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his\\n     chest and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in\\n     thought.\\n\\n     \\\"There will be no more murders,\\\" he said at last, stopping abruptly\\n     and facing us. \\\"You can put that consideration out of the question.\\n     You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere\\n     knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the\\n     power of laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do.\\n     I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it\\n     is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and\\n     desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion\\n     to prove, by another who is as clever as himself. As long as this man\\n     has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of\\n     securing him; but if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change\\n     his name, and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants\\n     of this great city. Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings,\\n     I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match\\n     for the official force, and that is why I have not asked your\\n     assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to\\n     this omission; but that I am prepared for. At present I am ready to\\n     promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without\\n     endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.\\\"\\n\\n     Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this\\n     assurance, or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police.\\n     The former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the\\n     other's beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither\\n     of them had time to speak, however, before there was a tap at the\\n     door, and the spokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins,\\n     introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person.\\n\\n     \\\"Please, sir,\\\" he said, touching his forelock, \\\"I have the cab\\n     downstairs.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Good boy,\\\" said Holmes, blandly. \\\"Why don't you introduce this\\n     pattern at Scotland Yard?\\\" he continued, taking a pair of steel\\n     handcuffs from a drawer. \\\"See how beautifully the spring works. They\\n     fasten in an instant.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"The old pattern is good enough,\\\" remarked Lestrade, \\\"if we can only\\n     find the man to put them on.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Very good, very good,\\\" said Holmes, smiling. \\\"The cabman may as well\\n     help me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.\\\"\\n\\n     I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about\\n     to set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about\\n     it. There was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out\\n     and began to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman\\n     entered the room.\\n\\n     \\\"Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,\\\" he said, kneeling\\n     over his task, and never turning his head.\\n\\n     The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put\\n     down his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click,\\n     the jangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\\n\\n     \\\"Gentlemen,\\\" he cried, with flashing eyes, \\\"let me introduce you to\\n     Mr. Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph\\n     Stangerson.\\\"\\n\\n     The whole thing occurred in a moment--so quickly that I had no time\\n     to realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of\\n     Holmes' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the\\n     cabman's dazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering\\n     handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a\\n     second or two we might have been a group of statues. Then, with an\\n     inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from\\n     Holmes's grasp, and hurled himself through the window. Woodwork and\\n     glass gave way before him; but before he got quite through, Gregson,\\n     Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. He was\\n     dragged back into the room, and then commenced a terrific conflict.\\n     So powerful and so fierce was he, that the four of us were shaken off\\n     again and again. He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man\\n     in an epileptic fit. His face and hands were terribly mangled by his\\n     passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no effect in\\n     diminishing his resistance. It was not until Lestrade succeeded in\\n     getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we\\n     made him realize that his struggles were of no avail; and even then\\n     we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his\\n     hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and panting.\\n\\n     \\\"We have his cab,\\\" said Sherlock Holmes. \\\"It will serve to take him\\n     to Scotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,\\\" he continued, with a pleasant\\n     smile, \\\"we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very\\n     welcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no\\n     danger that I will refuse to answer them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      PART II\\n\\n                           The Country of the Saints.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER I\\n          On The Great Alkali Plain\\n\\n\\n     In the central portion of the great North American Continent there\\n     lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served\\n     as a barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra\\n     Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to\\n     the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence.\\n     Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It\\n     comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy\\n     valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged\\n     ca\\u00f1ons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with\\n     snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. They all\\n     preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness,\\n     inhospitality, and misery.\\n\\n     There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees\\n     or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other\\n     hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose\\n     sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon\\n     their prairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps\\n     heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through\\n     the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the\\n     rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\\n\\n     In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from\\n     the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach\\n     stretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of\\n     alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes.\\n     On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain\\n     peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great\\n     stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything\\n     appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no\\n     movement upon the dull, grey earth--above all, there is absolute\\n     silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that\\n     mighty wilderness; nothing but silence--complete and heart-subduing\\n     silence.\\n\\n     It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad\\n     plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one\\n     sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is\\n     lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden\\n     down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are\\n     scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out\\n     against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They\\n     are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate.\\n     The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen\\n     hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these\\n     scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside.\\n\\n     Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,\\n     eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His\\n     appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon\\n     of the region. An observer would have found it difficult to say\\n     whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and\\n     haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the\\n     projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and\\n     dashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with\\n     an unnatural lustre; while the hand which grasped his rifle was\\n     hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned\\n     upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive\\n     framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution.\\n     His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so baggily over\\n     his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him that\\n     senile and decrepit appearance. The man was dying--dying from hunger\\n     and from thirst.\\n\\n     He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little\\n     elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the\\n     great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of\\n     savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which\\n     might indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape\\n     there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with\\n     wild questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had\\n     come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to\\n     die. \\\"Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\\\"\\n     he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\\n\\n     Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless\\n     rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had\\n     carried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too\\n     heavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the\\n     ground with some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey\\n     parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small,\\n     scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled,\\n     dimpled fists.\\n\\n     \\\"You've hurt me!\\\" said a childish voice reproachfully.\\n\\n     \\\"Have I though,\\\" the man answered penitently, \\\"I didn't go for to do\\n     it.\\\" As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty\\n     little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart\\n     pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother's care.\\n     The child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that\\n     she had suffered less than her companion.\\n\\n     \\\"How is it now?\\\" he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the\\n     towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\\n\\n     \\\"Kiss it and make it well,\\\" she said, with perfect gravity, shoving\\n     the injured part up to him. \\\"That's what mother used to do. Where's\\n     mother?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Mother's gone. I guess you'll see her before long.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Gone, eh!\\\" said the little girl. \\\"Funny, she didn't say good-bye;\\n     she 'most always did if she was just goin' over to Auntie's for tea,\\n     and now she's been away three days. Say, it's awful dry, ain't it?\\n     Ain't there no water, nor nothing to eat?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"No, there ain't nothing, dearie. You'll just need to be patient\\n     awhile, and then you'll be all right. Put your head up agin me like\\n     that, and then you'll feel bullier. It ain't easy to talk when your\\n     lips is like leather, but I guess I'd best let you know how the cards\\n     lie. What's that you've got?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Pretty things! fine things!\\\" cried the little girl enthusiastically,\\n     holding up two glittering fragments of mica. \\\"When we goes back to\\n     home I'll give them to brother Bob.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You'll see prettier things than them soon,\\\" said the man\\n     confidently. \\\"You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you\\n     though--you remember when we left the river?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Oh, yes.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Well, we reckoned we'd strike another river soon, d'ye see. But\\n     there was somethin' wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin', and it\\n     didn't turn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the\\n     likes of you and--and--\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And you couldn't wash yourself,\\\" interrupted his companion gravely,\\n     staring up at his grimy visage.\\n\\n     \\\"No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then\\n     Indian Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then,\\n     dearie, your mother.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Then mother's a deader too,\\\" cried the little girl dropping her face\\n     in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.\\n\\n     \\\"Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some\\n     chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder\\n     and we tramped it together. It don't seem as though we've improved\\n     matters. There's an almighty small chance for us now!\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Do you mean that we are going to die too?\\\" asked the child, checking\\n     her sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.\\n\\n     \\\"I guess that's about the size of it.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Why didn't you say so before?\\\" she said, laughing gleefully. \\\"You\\n     gave me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we'll be\\n     with mother again.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes, you will, dearie.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And you too. I'll tell her how awful good you've been. I'll bet she\\n     meets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot\\n     of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me\\n     was fond of. How long will it be first?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I don't know--not very long.\\\" The man's eyes were fixed upon the\\n     northern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared\\n     three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly\\n     did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large\\n     brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and\\n     then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were\\n     buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of\\n     death.\\n\\n     \\\"Cocks and hens,\\\" cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their\\n     ill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. \\\"Say, did\\n     God make this country?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Of course He did,\\\" said her companion, rather startled by this\\n     unexpected question.\\n\\n     \\\"He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,\\\" the\\n     little girl continued. \\\"I guess somebody else made the country in\\n     these parts. It's not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and\\n     the trees.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What would ye think of offering up prayer?\\\" the man asked\\n     diffidently.\\n\\n     \\\"It ain't night yet,\\\" she answered.\\n\\n     \\\"It don't matter. It ain't quite regular, but He won't mind that, you\\n     bet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the\\n     waggon when we was on the Plains.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Why don't you say some yourself?\\\" the child asked, with wondering\\n     eyes.\\n\\n     \\\"I disremember them,\\\" he answered. \\\"I hain't said none since I was\\n     half the height o' that gun. I guess it's never too late. You say\\n     them out, and I'll stand by and come in on the choruses.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Then you'll need to kneel down, and me too,\\\" she said, laying the\\n     shawl out for that purpose. \\\"You've got to put your hands up like\\n     this. It makes you feel kind o' good.\\\"\\n\\n     It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to\\n     see it. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the\\n     little prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her\\n     chubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to\\n     the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with\\n     whom they were face to face, while the two voices--the one thin and\\n     clear, the other deep and harsh--united in the entreaty for mercy and\\n     forgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the\\n     shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the\\n     broad breast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some\\n     time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and\\n     three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly\\n     the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and\\n     lower upon the breast, until the man's grizzled beard was mixed with\\n     the gold tresses of his companion, and both slept the same deep and\\n     dreamless slumber.\\n\\n     Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight\\n     would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali\\n     plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and\\n     hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but\\n     gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid,\\n     well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it\\n     became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of\\n     moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come\\n     to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze\\n     upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously\\n     impossible in these arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to\\n     the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the\\n     canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen\\n     began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself\\n     as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a\\n     caravan! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains,\\n     the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the\\n     enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men\\n     on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who staggered along\\n     under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped\\n     out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary\\n     party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been\\n     compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new\\n     country. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and\\n     rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of\\n     wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not\\n     sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them.\\n\\n     At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave\\n     ironfaced men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with\\n     rifles. On reaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a\\n     short council among themselves.\\n\\n     \\\"The wells are to the right, my brothers,\\\" said one, a hard-lipped,\\n     clean-shaven man with grizzly hair.\\n\\n     \\\"To the right of the Sierra Blanco--so we shall reach the Rio\\n     Grande,\\\" said another.\\n\\n     \\\"Fear not for water,\\\" cried a third. \\\"He who could draw it from the\\n     rocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Amen! Amen!\\\" responded the whole party.\\n\\n     They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and\\n     keenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag\\n     above them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink,\\n     showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the\\n     sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of\\n     guns, while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the\\n     vanguard. The word \\\"Redskins\\\" was on every lip.\\n\\n     \\\"There can't be any number of Injuns here,\\\" said the elderly man who\\n     appeared to be in command. \\\"We have passed the Pawnees, and there are\\n     no other tribes until we cross the great mountains.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,\\\" asked one of the\\n     band.\\n\\n     \\\"And I,\\\" \\\"and I,\\\" cried a dozen voices.\\n\\n     \\\"Leave your horses below and we will await you here,\\\" the Elder\\n     answered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened\\n     their horses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up\\n     to the object which had excited their curiosity. They advanced\\n     rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of\\n     practised scouts. The watchers from the plain below could see them\\n     flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the\\n     skyline. The young man who had first given the alarm was leading\\n     them. Suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands, as though\\n     overcome with astonishment, and on joining him they were affected in\\n     the same way by the sight which met their eyes.\\n\\n     On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a\\n     single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man,\\n     long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His\\n     placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep.\\n     Beside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling\\n     his brown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the\\n     breast of his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the\\n     regular line of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played\\n     over her infantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating\\n     in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange\\n     contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the\\n     ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn\\n     buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams\\n     of disappointment and flapped sullenly away.\\n\\n     The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about\\n     them in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down\\n     upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken\\n     him, and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of\\n     beasts. His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed,\\n     and he passed his boney hand over his eyes. \\\"This is what they call\\n     delirium, I guess,\\\" he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding\\n     on to the skirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round\\n     her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood.\\n\\n     The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways\\n     that their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little\\n     girl, and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported\\n     her gaunt companion, and assisted him towards the waggons.\\n\\n     \\\"My name is John Ferrier,\\\" the wanderer explained; \\\"me and that\\n     little un are all that's left o' twenty-one people. The rest is all\\n     dead o' thirst and hunger away down in the south.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Is she your child?\\\" asked someone.\\n\\n     \\\"I guess she is now,\\\" the other cried, defiantly; \\\"she's mine 'cause\\n     I saved her. No man will take her from me. She's Lucy Ferrier from\\n     this day on. Who are you, though?\\\" he continued, glancing with\\n     curiosity at his stalwart, sunburned rescuers; \\\"there seems to be a\\n     powerful lot of ye.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Nigh upon ten thousand,\\\" said one of the young men; \\\"we are the\\n     persecuted children of God--the chosen of the Angel Merona.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I never heard tell on him,\\\" said the wanderer. \\\"He appears to have\\n     chosen a fair crowd of ye.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Do not jest at that which is sacred,\\\" said the other sternly. \\\"We\\n     are of those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian\\n     letters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy\\n     Joseph Smith at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of\\n     Illinois, where we had founded our temple. We have come to seek a\\n     refuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be\\n     the heart of the desert.\\\"\\n\\n     The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier.\\n     \\\"I see,\\\" he said, \\\"you are the Mormons.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"We are the Mormons,\\\" answered his companions with one voice.\\n\\n     \\\"And where are you going?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of\\n     our Prophet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be\\n     done with you.\\\"\\n\\n     They had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were\\n     surrounded by crowds of the pilgrims--pale-faced meek-looking women,\\n     strong laughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the\\n     cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when\\n     they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution\\n     of the other. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on,\\n     followed by a great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon,\\n     which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and\\n     smartness of its appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the\\n     others were furnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the\\n     driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years\\n     of age, but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as\\n     a leader. He was reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd\\n     approached he laid it aside, and listened attentively to an account\\n     of the episode. Then he turned to the two castaways.\\n\\n     \\\"If we take you with us,\\\" he said, in solemn words, \\\"it can only be\\n     as believers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold.\\n     Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that\\n     you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time\\n     corrupts the whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Guess I'll come with you on any terms,\\\" said Ferrier, with such\\n     emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader\\n     alone retained his stern, impressive expression.\\n\\n     \\\"Take him, Brother Stangerson,\\\" he said, \\\"give him food and drink,\\n     and the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our\\n     holy creed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"On, on to Zion!\\\" cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled\\n     down the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died\\n     away in a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips\\n     and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon\\n     the whole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose\\n     care the two waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where\\n     a meal was already awaiting them.\\n\\n     \\\"You shall remain here,\\\" he said. \\\"In a few days you will have\\n     recovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and\\n     forever you are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he\\n     has spoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of\\n     God.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER II\\n          The Flower Of Utah\\n\\n\\n     This is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations\\n     endured by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final\\n     haven. From the shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of\\n     the Rocky Mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost\\n     unparalleled in history. The savage man, and the savage beast,\\n     hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease--every impediment which Nature\\n     could place in the way--had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon\\n     tenacity. Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken\\n     the hearts of the stoutest among them. There was not one who did not\\n     sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad\\n     valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them, and learned from\\n     the lips of their leader that this was the promised land, and that\\n     these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore.\\n\\n     Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well\\n     as a resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which\\n     the future city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned\\n     and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The\\n     tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the\\n     town streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country\\n     there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next\\n     summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything\\n     prospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple\\n     which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and\\n     larger. From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the\\n     twilight, the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never\\n     absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to Him who had\\n     led them safe through many dangers.\\n\\n     The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared\\n     his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the\\n     Mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was\\n     borne along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson's waggon, a retreat\\n     which she shared with the Mormon's three wives and with his son, a\\n     headstrong forward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity\\n     of childhood, from the shock caused by her mother's death, she soon\\n     became a pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life\\n     in her moving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having\\n     recovered from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful\\n     guide and an indefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem\\n     of his new companions, that when they reached the end of their\\n     wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with\\n     as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with\\n     the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston,\\n     and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders.\\n\\n     On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial\\n     log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that\\n     it grew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind,\\n     keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron\\n     constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and\\n     tilling his lands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that\\n     belonged to him prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better\\n     off than his neighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was\\n     rich, and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of\\n     Salt Lake City who could compare with him. From the great inland sea\\n     to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than\\n     that of John Ferrier.\\n\\n     There was one way and only one in which he offended the\\n     susceptibilities of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion\\n     could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the\\n     manner of his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent\\n     refusal, but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering\\n     to his determination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness\\n     in his adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of\\n     wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some\\n     early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on\\n     the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained\\n     strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed to the\\n     religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an\\n     orthodox and straight-walking man.\\n\\n     Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted\\n     father in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the\\n     balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother\\n     to the young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and\\n     stronger, her cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a\\n     wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier's farm felt\\n     long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her\\n     lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her\\n     mounted upon her father's mustang, and managing it with all the ease\\n     and grace of a true child of the West. So the bud blossomed into a\\n     flower, and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers\\n     left her as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be found in\\n     the whole Pacific slope.\\n\\n     It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child\\n     had developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That\\n     mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by\\n     dates. Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of\\n     a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her,\\n     and she learns, with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a\\n     larger nature has awoken within her. There are few who cannot recall\\n     that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn\\n     of a new life. In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious\\n     enough in itself, apart from its future influence on her destiny and\\n     that of many besides.\\n\\n     It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as\\n     the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields\\n     and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the\\n     dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all\\n     heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California,\\n     and the Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too,\\n     were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture\\n     lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary\\n     of their interminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage,\\n     threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there\\n     galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and\\n     her long chestnut hair floating out behind her. She had a commission\\n     from her father in the City, and was dashing in as she had done many\\n     a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of\\n     her task and how it was to be performed. The travel-stained\\n     adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even the unemotional\\n     Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their accustomed\\n     stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden.\\n\\n     She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road\\n     blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen\\n     wild-looking herdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she\\n     endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what\\n     appeared to be a gap. Scarcely had she got fairly into it, however,\\n     before the beasts closed in behind her, and she found herself\\n     completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed, long-horned\\n     bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not\\n     alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of every opportunity to\\n     urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the\\n     cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by\\n     accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the\\n     mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon\\n     its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way\\n     that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation\\n     was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it\\n     against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all\\n     that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip\\n     would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and\\n     terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began\\n     to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising\\n     cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she\\n     might have abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice\\n     at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a\\n     sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and\\n     forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.\\n\\n     \\\"You're not hurt, I hope, miss,\\\" said her preserver, respectfully.\\n\\n     She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. \\\"I'm\\n     awful frightened,\\\" she said, naively; \\\"whoever would have thought\\n     that Poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Thank God you kept your seat,\\\" the other said earnestly. He was a\\n     tall, savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse,\\n     and clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over\\n     his shoulders. \\\"I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,\\\" he\\n     remarked, \\\"I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask\\n     him if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he's the\\n     same Ferrier, my father and he were pretty thick.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Hadn't you better come and ask yourself?\\\" she asked, demurely.\\n\\n     The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes\\n     sparkled with pleasure. \\\"I'll do so,\\\" he said, \\\"we've been in the\\n     mountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting\\n     condition. He must take us as he finds us.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,\\\" she answered,\\n     \\\"he's awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he'd have\\n     never got over it.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Neither would I,\\\" said her companion.\\n\\n     \\\"You! Well, I don't see that it would make much matter to you,\\n     anyhow. You ain't even a friend of ours.\\\"\\n\\n     The young hunter's dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that\\n     Lucy Ferrier laughed aloud.\\n\\n     \\\"There, I didn't mean that,\\\" she said; \\\"of course, you are a friend\\n     now. You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won't\\n     trust me with his business any more. Good-bye!\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Good-bye,\\\" he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over\\n     her little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with\\n     her riding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling\\n     cloud of dust.\\n\\n     Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and\\n     taciturn. He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting\\n     for silver, and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of\\n     raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered.\\n     He had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this\\n     sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel. The\\n     sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra\\n     breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths.\\n     When she had vanished from his sight, he realized that a crisis had\\n     come in his life, and that neither silver speculations nor any other\\n     questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and\\n     all-absorbing one. The love which had sprung up in his heart was not\\n     the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce\\n     passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He had been\\n     accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in his heart\\n     that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance\\n     could render him successful.\\n\\n     He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his\\n     face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the\\n     valley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning\\n     the news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this\\n     Jefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested\\n     Lucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and\\n     could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost\\n     in those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper,\\n     a silver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were\\n     to be had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon\\n     became a favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his\\n     virtues. On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek\\n     and her bright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young\\n     heart was no longer her own. Her honest father may not have observed\\n     these symptoms, but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man\\n     who had won her affections.\\n\\n     It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and\\n     pulled up at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet\\n     him. He threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.\\n\\n     \\\"I am off, Lucy,\\\" he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing\\n     tenderly down into her face; \\\"I won't ask you to come with me now,\\n     but will you be ready to come when I am here again?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And when will that be?\\\" she asked, blushing and laughing.\\n\\n     \\\"A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then,\\n     my darling. There's no one who can stand between us.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And how about father?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n     \\\"He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all\\n     right. I have no fear on that head.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there's\\n     no more to be said,\\\" she whispered, with her cheek against his broad\\n     breast.\\n\\n     \\\"Thank God!\\\" he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. \\\"It is\\n     settled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They\\n     are waiting for me at the ca\\u00f1on. Good-bye, my own darling--good-bye.\\n     In two months you shall see me.\\\"\\n\\n     He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his\\n     horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though\\n     afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at\\n     what he was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he\\n     vanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the\\n     happiest girl in all Utah.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER III\\n          John Ferrier Talks With The Prophet\\n\\n\\n     Three weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had\\n     departed from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier's heart was sore within\\n     him when he thought of the young man's return, and of the impending\\n     loss of his adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled\\n     him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had\\n     always determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing\\n     would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a\\n     marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a\\n     disgrace. Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that\\n     one point he was inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject,\\n     however, for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter\\n     in those days in the Land of the Saints.\\n\\n     Yes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly\\n     dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest\\n     something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring\\n     down a swift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had\\n     now turned persecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the\\n     most terrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the\\n     German Vehmgericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able\\n     to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a\\n     cloud over the State of Utah.\\n\\n     Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this\\n     organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and\\n     omnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out\\n     against the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone\\n     or what had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at\\n     home, but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at\\n     the hands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was\\n     followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be\\n     of this terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that\\n     men went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of\\n     the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed\\n     them.\\n\\n     At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the\\n     recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished\\n     afterwards to pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a\\n     wider range. The supply of adult women was running short, and\\n     polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren\\n     doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to be bandied about--rumours\\n     of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had\\n     never been seen. Fresh women appeared in the harems of the\\n     Elders--women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the\\n     traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the\\n     mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked, stealthy, and\\n     noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These tales and\\n     rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and\\n     re-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.\\n     To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the\\n     Danite Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened\\n     one.\\n\\n     Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible\\n     results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it\\n     inspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless\\n     society. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and\\n     violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.\\n     The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the\\n     Prophet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth\\n     at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence\\n     every man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which\\n     were nearest his heart.\\n\\n     One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his\\n     wheatfields, when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking\\n     through the window, saw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming\\n     up the pathway. His heart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other\\n     than the great Brigham Young himself. Full of trepidation--for he\\n     knew that such a visit boded him little good--Ferrier ran to the door\\n     to greet the Mormon chief. The latter, however, received his\\n     salutations coldly, and followed him with a stern face into the\\n     sitting-room.\\n\\n     \\\"Brother Ferrier,\\\" he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer\\n     keenly from under his light-coloured eyelashes, \\\"the true believers\\n     have been good friends to you. We picked you up when you were\\n     starving in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to\\n     the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you\\n     to wax rich under our protection. Is not this so?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It is so,\\\" answered John Ferrier.\\n\\n     \\\"In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that\\n     you should embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its\\n     usages. This you promised to do, and this, if common report says\\n     truly, you have neglected.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And how have I neglected it?\\\" asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands\\n     in expostulation. \\\"Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not\\n     attended at the Temple? Have I not--?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Where are your wives?\\\" asked Young, looking round him. \\\"Call them\\n     in, that I may greet them.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It is true that I have not married,\\\" Ferrier answered. \\\"But women\\n     were few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not\\n     a lonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,\\\" said the leader\\n     of the Mormons. \\\"She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has\\n     found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.\\\"\\n\\n     John Ferrier groaned internally.\\n\\n     \\\"There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve--stories that\\n     she is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle\\n     tongues. What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted\\n     Joseph Smith? 'Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the\\n     elect; for if she wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.' This\\n     being so, it is impossible that you, who profess the holy creed,\\n     should suffer your daughter to violate it.\\\"\\n\\n     John Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his\\n     riding-whip.\\n\\n     \\\"Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested--so it has been\\n     decided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we\\n     would not have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of\\n     all choice. We Elders have many heifers*1, but our children must also\\n     be provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either\\n     of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her\\n     choose between them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith.\\n     What say you to that?\\\"\\n\\n     Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.\\n\\n     \\\"You will give us time,\\\" he said at last. \\\"My daughter is very\\n     young--she is scarce of an age to marry.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"She shall have a month to choose,\\\" said Young, rising from his seat.\\n     \\\"At the end of that time she shall give her answer.\\\"\\n\\n     He was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face\\n     and flashing eyes. \\\"It were better for you, John Ferrier,\\\" he\\n     thundered, \\\"that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon\\n     the Sierra Blanco, than that you should put your weak wills against\\n     the orders of the Holy Four!\\\"\\n\\n     With a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and\\n     Ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.\\n\\n     He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how\\n     he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid\\n     upon his, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance\\n     at her pale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had\\n     passed.\\n\\n     \\\"I could not help it,\\\" she said, in answer to his look. \\\"His voice\\n     rang through the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Don't you scare yourself,\\\" he answered, drawing her to him, and\\n     passing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair.\\n     \\\"We'll fix it up somehow or another. You don't find your fancy kind\\n     o' lessening for this chap, do you?\\\"\\n\\n     A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.\\n\\n     \\\"No; of course not. I shouldn't care to hear you say you did. He's a\\n     likely lad, and he's a Christian, which is more than these folk here,\\n     in spite o' all their praying and preaching. There's a party starting\\n     for Nevada to-morrow, and I'll manage to send him a message letting\\n     him know the hole we are in. If I know anything o' that young man,\\n     he'll be back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.\\\"\\n\\n     Lucy laughed through her tears at her father's description.\\n\\n     \\\"When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you\\n     that I am frightened, dear. One hears--one hears such dreadful\\n     stories about those who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always\\n     happens to them.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"But we haven't opposed him yet,\\\" her father answered. \\\"It will be\\n     time to look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before\\n     us; at the end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Leave Utah!\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"That's about the size of it.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"But the farm?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To\\n     tell the truth, Lucy, it isn't the first time I have thought of doing\\n     it. I don't care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do\\n     to their darned prophet. I'm a free-born American, and it's all new\\n     to me. Guess I'm too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this\\n     farm, he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot\\n     travelling in the opposite direction.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"But they won't let us leave,\\\" his daughter objected.\\n\\n     \\\"Wait till Jefferson comes, and we'll soon manage that. In the\\n     meantime, don't you fret yourself, my dearie, and don't get your eyes\\n     swelled up, else he'll be walking into me when he sees you. There's\\n     nothing to be afeared about, and there's no danger at all.\\\"\\n\\n     John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident\\n     tone, but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to\\n     the fastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned\\n     and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his\\n     bedroom.\\n\\n     -----\\n     *1: Heber C Kemball, in one of his sermons, alludes to his hundred\\n     wives under this endearing epithet.\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER IV\\n          A Flight For Life\\n\\n\\n     On the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet,\\n     John Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his\\n     acquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted\\n     him with his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man\\n     of the imminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it\\n     was that he should return. Having done thus he felt easier in his\\n     mind, and returned home with a lighter heart.\\n\\n     As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to\\n     each of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on\\n     entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room.\\n     One, with a long pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair,\\n     with his feet cocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked\\n     youth with coarse bloated features, was standing in front of the\\n     window with his hands in his pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both\\n     of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered, and the one in the\\n     rocking-chair commenced the conversation.\\n\\n     \\\"Maybe you don't know us,\\\" he said. \\\"This here is the son of Elder\\n     Drebber, and I'm Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the\\n     desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the\\n     true fold.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"As He will all the nations in His own good time,\\\" said the other in\\n     a nasal voice; \\\"He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.\\\"\\n\\n     John Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.\\n\\n     \\\"We have come,\\\" continued Stangerson, \\\"at the advice of our fathers\\n     to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem\\n     good to you and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber\\n     here has seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,\\\" cried the other; \\\"the question is not\\n     how many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now\\n     given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"But my prospects are better,\\\" said the other, warmly. \\\"When the Lord\\n     removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather\\n     factory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It will be for the maiden to decide,\\\" rejoined young Drebber,\\n     smirking at his own reflection in the glass. \\\"We will leave it all to\\n     her decision.\\\"\\n\\n     During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway,\\n     hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two\\n     visitors.\\n\\n     \\\"Look here,\\\" he said at last, striding up to them, \\\"when my daughter\\n     summons you, you can come, but until then I don't want to see your\\n     faces again.\\\"\\n\\n     The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this\\n     competition between them for the maiden's hand was the highest of\\n     honours both to her and her father.\\n\\n     \\\"There are two ways out of the room,\\\" cried Ferrier; \\\"there is the\\n     door, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?\\\"\\n\\n     His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening,\\n     that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat.\\n     The old farmer followed them to the door.\\n\\n     \\\"Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,\\\" he said,\\n     sardonically.\\n\\n     \\\"You shall smart for this!\\\" Stangerson cried, white with rage. \\\"You\\n     have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to\\n     the end of your days.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,\\\" cried young Drebber;\\n     \\\"He will arise and smite you!\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Then I'll start the smiting,\\\" exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would\\n     have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm\\n     and restrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of\\n     horses' hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.\\n\\n     \\\"The young canting rascals!\\\" he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration\\n     from his forehead; \\\"I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl,\\n     than the wife of either of them.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And so should I, father,\\\" she answered, with spirit; \\\"but Jefferson\\n     will soon be here.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for\\n     we do not know what their next move may be.\\\"\\n\\n     It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and\\n     help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted\\n     daughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been\\n     such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If\\n     minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this\\n     arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no\\n     avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been\\n     spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church.\\n     He was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors\\n     which hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip,\\n     but this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his\\n     daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter,\\n     though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at\\n     ease.\\n\\n     He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from\\n     Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in\\n     an unlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his\\n     surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his\\n     bed just over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling\\n     letters:--\\n\\n     \\\"Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then--\\\"\\n\\n     The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How\\n     this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his\\n     servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been\\n     secured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter,\\n     but the incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days\\n     were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised.\\n     What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such\\n     mysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck\\n     him to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.\\n\\n     Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their\\n     breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the\\n     centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently,\\n     the number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not\\n     enlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and\\n     ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27\\n     had been painted upon the outside of his door.\\n\\n     Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his\\n     unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some\\n     conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the\\n     month of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,\\n     sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards\\n     stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance\\n     John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings\\n     proceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at\\n     the sight of them. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had\\n     the troubled look of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in\\n     life now, and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from\\n     Nevada.\\n\\n     Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no\\n     news of the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still\\n     there came no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the\\n     road, or a driver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the\\n     gate thinking that help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw\\n     five give way to four and that again to three, he lost heart, and\\n     abandoned all hope of escape. Single-handed, and with his limited\\n     knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew\\n     that he was powerless. The more-frequented roads were strictly\\n     watched and guarded, and none could pass along them without an order\\n     from the Council. Turn which way he would, there appeared to be no\\n     avoiding the blow which hung over him. Yet the old man never wavered\\n     in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to\\n     what he regarded as his daughter's dishonour.\\n\\n     He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles,\\n     and searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown\\n     the figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be\\n     the last of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of\\n     vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his\\n     daughter--what was to become of her after he was gone? Was there no\\n     escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them. He\\n     sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own\\n     impotence.\\n\\n     What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching\\n     sound--low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from\\n     the door of the house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened\\n     intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low\\n     insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very\\n     gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight\\n     assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret\\n     tribunal? Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day\\n     of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be\\n     better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his\\n     heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open.\\n\\n     Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars\\n     were twinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before\\n     the farmer's eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there\\n     nor on the road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of\\n     relief, Ferrier looked to right and to left, until happening to\\n     glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man\\n     lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and legs all\\n     asprawl.\\n\\n     So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall\\n     with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out.\\n     His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some\\n     wounded or dying man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the\\n     ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a\\n     serpent. Once within the house the man sprang to his feet, closed the\\n     door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and\\n     resolute expression of Jefferson Hope.\\n\\n     \\\"Good God!\\\" gasped John Ferrier. \\\"How you scared me! Whatever made\\n     you come in like that.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Give me food,\\\" the other said, hoarsely. \\\"I have had no time for\\n     bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours.\\\" He flung himself upon the\\n     cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his\\n     host's supper, and devoured it voraciously. \\\"Does Lucy bear up well?\\\"\\n     he asked, when he had satisfied his hunger.\\n\\n     \\\"Yes. She does not know the danger,\\\" her father answered.\\n\\n     \\\"That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I\\n     crawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they're not\\n     quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.\\\"\\n\\n     John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a\\n     devoted ally. He seized the young man's leathery hand and wrung it\\n     cordially. \\\"You're a man to be proud of,\\\" he said. \\\"There are not\\n     many who would come to share our danger and our troubles.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You've hit it there, pard,\\\" the young hunter answered. \\\"I have a\\n     respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I'd think\\n     twice before I put my head into such a hornet's nest. It's Lucy that\\n     brings me here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be\\n     one less o' the Hope family in Utah.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What are we to do?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are\\n     lost. I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How\\n     much money have you?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for\\n     Carson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as\\n     well that the servants do not sleep in the house.\\\"\\n\\n     While Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching\\n     journey, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find\\n     into a small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he\\n     knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between.\\n     He had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned\\n     with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting\\n     between the lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious,\\n     and there was much to be done.\\n\\n     \\\"We must make our start at once,\\\" said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a\\n     low but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the\\n     peril, but has steeled his heart to meet it. \\\"The front and back\\n     entrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the\\n     side window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two\\n     miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we\\n     should be half-way through the mountains.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What if we are stopped,\\\" asked Ferrier.\\n\\n     Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his\\n     tunic. \\\"If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of\\n     them with us,\\\" he said with a sinister smile.\\n\\n     The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the\\n     darkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his\\n     own, and which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long\\n     nerved himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the\\n     honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his\\n     ruined fortunes. All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees\\n     and the broad silent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to\\n     realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the\\n     white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his\\n     approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that\\n     head.\\n\\n     Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the\\n     scanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing\\n     a few of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly\\n     and carefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured\\n     the night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden.\\n     With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and\\n     gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came\\n     to the gap which opened into the cornfields. They had just reached\\n     this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged\\n     them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling.\\n\\n     It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the\\n     ears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before\\n     the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards\\n     of them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small\\n     distance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the\\n     gap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal\\n     cry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.\\n\\n     \\\"To-morrow at midnight,\\\" said the first who appeared to be in\\n     authority. \\\"When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It is well,\\\" returned the other. \\\"Shall I tell Brother Drebber?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Seven to five!\\\" repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away\\n     in different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been\\n     some form of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps\\n     had died away in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and\\n     helping his companions through the gap, led the way across the fields\\n     at the top of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when\\n     her strength appeared to fail her.\\n\\n     \\\"Hurry on! hurry on!\\\" he gasped from time to time. \\\"We are through\\n     the line of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!\\\"\\n\\n     Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they\\n     meet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid\\n     recognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a\\n     rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark\\n     jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile\\n     which led between them was the Eagle Ca\\u00f1on in which the horses were\\n     awaiting them. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way\\n     among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse,\\n     until he came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the\\n     faithful animals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the\\n     mule, and old Ferrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag,\\n     while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and\\n     dangerous path.\\n\\n     It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face\\n     Nature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up\\n     a thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long\\n     basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some\\n     petrified monster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and\\n     debris made all advance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular\\n     track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file,\\n     and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at\\n     all. Yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the\\n     fugitives were light within them, for every step increased the\\n     distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were\\n     flying.\\n\\n     They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the\\n     jurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and\\n     most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry,\\n     and pointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing\\n     out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel.\\n     He saw them as soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge\\n     of \\\"Who goes there?\\\" rang through the silent ravine.\\n\\n     \\\"Travellers for Nevada,\\\" said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the\\n     rifle which hung by his saddle.\\n\\n     They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down\\n     at them as if dissatisfied at their reply.\\n\\n     \\\"By whose permission?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n     \\\"The Holy Four,\\\" answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught\\n     him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer.\\n\\n     \\\"Nine from seven,\\\" cried the sentinel.\\n\\n     \\\"Seven from five,\\\" returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the\\n     countersign which he had heard in the garden.\\n\\n     \\\"Pass, and the Lord go with you,\\\" said the voice from above. Beyond\\n     his post the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break\\n     into a trot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher\\n     leaning upon his gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post\\n     of the chosen people, and that freedom lay before them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER V\\n          The Avenging Angels\\n\\n\\n     All night their course lay through intricate defiles and over\\n     irregular and rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way,\\n     but Hope's intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain\\n     the track once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though\\n     savage beauty lay before them. In every direction the great\\n     snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other's shoulders\\n     to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of\\n     them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their\\n     heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon\\n     them. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley\\n     was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a\\n     similar manner. Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering\\n     down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges,\\n     and startled the weary horses into a gallop.\\n\\n     As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the\\n     great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival,\\n     until they were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle\\n     cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy.\\n     At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and\\n     watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy\\n     and her father would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was\\n     inexorable. \\\"They will be upon our track by this time,\\\" he said.\\n     \\\"Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest\\n     for the remainder of our lives.\\\"\\n\\n     During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles,\\n     and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles\\n     from their enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling\\n     crag, where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind,\\n     and there huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours'\\n     sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once\\n     more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope\\n     began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible\\n     organization whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far\\n     that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them\\n     and crush them.\\n\\n     About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store\\n     of provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little\\n     uneasiness, however, for there was game to be had among the\\n     mountains, and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle\\n     for the needs of life. Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a\\n     few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions\\n     might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet\\n     above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered\\n     the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder,\\n     and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way.\\n     Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the\\n     blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the\\n     back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view.\\n\\n     He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another\\n     without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees,\\n     and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in\\n     the vicinity. At last, after two or three hours' fruitless search, he\\n     was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes\\n     upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his\\n     heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet\\n     above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in\\n     appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The\\n     big-horn--for so it is called--was acting, probably, as a guardian\\n     over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it\\n     was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him.\\n     Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long\\n     and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang into the\\n     air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then\\n     came crashing down into the valley beneath.\\n\\n     The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented\\n     himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this\\n     trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the\\n     evening was already drawing in. He had hardly started, however,\\n     before he realized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness\\n     he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it\\n     was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The\\n     valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many\\n     gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to\\n     distinguish one from the other. He followed one for a mile or more\\n     until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had\\n     never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he\\n     tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly,\\n     and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile\\n     which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to\\n     the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs\\n     on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with\\n     his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping\\n     up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to\\n     Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the\\n     remainder of their journey.\\n\\n     He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left\\n     them. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the\\n     cliffs which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him\\n     anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness\\n     of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo\\n     to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and\\n     listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered\\n     up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in\\n     countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and\\n     again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a\\n     short time ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried\\n     onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation.\\n\\n     When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where\\n     the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes\\n     there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The\\n     same dead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed\\n     to convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the\\n     remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only\\n     too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during\\n     his absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left\\n     no traces behind it.\\n\\n     Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head\\n     spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from\\n     falling. He was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily\\n     recovered from his temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece\\n     of wood from the smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and\\n     proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. The ground was\\n     all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party of\\n     mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their\\n     tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City.\\n     Had they carried back both of his companions with them? Jefferson\\n     Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when\\n     his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle\\n     within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap\\n     of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was\\n     no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As the young\\n     hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on\\n     it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The\\n     inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:\\n\\n                                  JOHN FERRIER,\\n                           Formerly of Salt Lake City,\\n                             Died August 4th, 1860.\\n                                        \\n\\n     The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was\\n     gone, then, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked\\n     wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no\\n     sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to\\n     fulfil her original destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the\\n     Elder's son. As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate,\\n     and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was\\n     lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place.\\n\\n     Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which\\n     springs from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could\\n     at least devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and\\n     perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained\\n     vindictiveness, which he may have learned from the Indians amongst\\n     whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the\\n     only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and\\n     complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His\\n     strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to\\n     that one end. With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where\\n     he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire,\\n     he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he made up into a\\n     bundle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back through the\\n     mountains upon the track of the avenging angels.\\n\\n     For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which\\n     he had already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down\\n     among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before\\n     daybreak he was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached\\n     the Eagle Ca\\u00f1on, from which they had commenced their ill-fated\\n     flight. Thence he could look down upon the home of the saints. Worn\\n     and exhausted, he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand\\n     fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him. As he looked at\\n     it, he observed that there were flags in some of the principal\\n     streets, and other signs of festivity. He was still speculating as to\\n     what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse's hoofs, and\\n     saw a mounted man riding towards him. As he approached, he recognized\\n     him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at\\n     different times. He therefore accosted him when he got up to him,\\n     with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier's fate had been.\\n\\n     \\\"I am Jefferson Hope,\\\" he said. \\\"You remember me.\\\"\\n\\n     The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment--indeed, it\\n     was difficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with\\n     ghastly white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of\\n     former days. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his\\n     identity, the man's surprise changed to consternation.\\n\\n     \\\"You are mad to come here,\\\" he cried. \\\"It is as much as my own life\\n     is worth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you\\n     from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I don't fear them, or their warrant,\\\" Hope said, earnestly. \\\"You\\n     must know something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by\\n     everything you hold dear to answer a few questions. We have always\\n     been friends. For God's sake, don't refuse to answer me.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What is it?\\\" the Mormon asked uneasily. \\\"Be quick. The very rocks\\n     have ears and the trees eyes.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What has become of Lucy Ferrier?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up,\\n     you have no life left in you.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Don't mind me,\\\" said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips,\\n     and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning.\\n     \\\"Married, you say?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Married yesterday--that's what those flags are for on the Endowment\\n     House. There was some words between young Drebber and young\\n     Stangerson as to which was to have her. They'd both been in the party\\n     that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed\\n     to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council,\\n     Drebber's party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to\\n     him. No one won't have her very long though, for I saw death in her\\n     face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off,\\n     then?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes, I am off,\\\" said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat.\\n     His face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was\\n     its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\\n\\n     \\\"Where are you going?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Never mind,\\\" he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his\\n     shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the\\n     mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there\\n     was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself.\\n\\n     The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it\\n     was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful\\n     marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her\\n     head again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish\\n     husband, who had married her principally for the sake of John\\n     Ferrier's property, did not affect any great grief at his\\n     bereavement; but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with\\n     her the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were\\n     grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to\\n     their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open,\\n     and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode\\n     into the room. Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he\\n     walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the\\n     pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips\\n     reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he\\n     took the wedding-ring from her finger. \\\"She shall not be buried in\\n     that,\\\" he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be\\n     raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief\\n     was the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to\\n     believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been\\n     for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as\\n     having been a bride had disappeared.\\n\\n     For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading\\n     a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for\\n     vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the\\n     weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which\\n     haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through\\n     Stangerson's window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot\\n     of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great\\n     boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by\\n     throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long\\n     in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led\\n     repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or\\n     killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted\\n     the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of\\n     having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax\\n     these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their\\n     opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.\\n\\n     Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter's\\n     mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of\\n     revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no\\n     room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things\\n     practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not\\n     stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and\\n     want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog\\n     among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet\\n     such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that\\n     that was to play his enemy's game, so he reluctantly returned to the\\n     old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money\\n     enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation.\\n\\n     His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a\\n     combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the\\n     mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory\\n     of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on\\n     that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier's grave.\\n     Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City,\\n     careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he\\n     knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There\\n     had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some\\n     of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the\\n     authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a\\n     certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become\\n     Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one\\n     knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed\\n     to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had\\n     departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was\\n     comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their\\n     whereabouts.\\n\\n     Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of\\n     revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never\\n     faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked\\n     out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to\\n     town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed\\n     into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on,\\n     a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon\\n     which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded.\\n     It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told\\n     him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit\\n     of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance\\n     all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his\\n     window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder\\n     in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by\\n     Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to\\n     him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and\\n     hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into\\n     custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some\\n     weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that\\n     Drebber's house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had\\n     departed for Europe.\\n\\n     Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred\\n     urged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and\\n     for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his\\n     approaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in\\n     him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to\\n     city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking\\n     the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for\\n     Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just\\n     set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days\\n     late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded\\n     in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do\\n     better than quote the old hunter's own account, as duly recorded in\\n     Dr. Watson's Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER VI\\n          A Continuation Of The Reminiscences Of John Watson, M.D.\\n\\n\\n     Our prisoner's furious resistance did not apparently indicate any\\n     ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself\\n     powerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes\\n     that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. \\\"I guess you're going\\n     to take me to the police-station,\\\" he remarked to Sherlock Holmes.\\n     \\\"My cab's at the door. If you'll loose my legs I'll walk down to it.\\n     I'm not so light to lift as I used to be.\\\"\\n\\n     Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this\\n     proposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner\\n     at his word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his\\n     ankles. He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself\\n     that they were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself,\\n     as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man;\\n     and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and\\n     energy which was as formidable as his personal strength.\\n\\n     \\\"If there's a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you\\n     are the man for it,\\\" he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at\\n     my fellow-lodger. \\\"The way you kept on my trail was a caution.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You had better come with me,\\\" said Holmes to the two detectives.\\n\\n     \\\"I can drive you,\\\" said Lestrade.\\n\\n     \\\"Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have\\n     taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.\\\"\\n\\n     I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made\\n     no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been\\n     his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the\\n     horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We\\n     were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down\\n     our prisoner's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had\\n     been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who\\n     went through his duties in a dull mechanical way. \\\"The prisoner will\\n     be put before the magistrates in the course of the week,\\\" he said;\\n     \\\"in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you\\n     wish to say? I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and\\n     may be used against you.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I've got a good deal to say,\\\" our prisoner said slowly. \\\"I want to\\n     tell you gentlemen all about it.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Hadn't you better reserve that for your trial?\\\" asked the Inspector.\\n\\n     \\\"I may never be tried,\\\" he answered. \\\"You needn't look startled. It\\n     isn't suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?\\\" He turned his\\n     fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.\\n\\n     \\\"Yes; I am,\\\" I answered.\\n\\n     \\\"Then put your hand here,\\\" he said, with a smile, motioning with his\\n     manacled wrists towards his chest.\\n\\n     I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing\\n     and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest\\n     seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when\\n     some powerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could\\n     hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same\\n     source.\\n\\n     \\\"Why,\\\" I cried, \\\"you have an aortic aneurism!\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"That's what they call it,\\\" he said, placidly. \\\"I went to a Doctor\\n     last week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before\\n     many days passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from\\n     over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I've\\n     done my work now, and I don't care how soon I go, but I should like\\n     to leave some account of the business behind me. I don't want to be\\n     remembered as a common cut-throat.\\\"\\n\\n     The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to\\n     the advisability of allowing him to tell his story.\\n\\n     \\\"Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?\\\" the former\\n     asked.\\n\\n     \\\"Most certainly there is,\\\" I answered.\\n\\n     \\\"In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to\\n     take his statement,\\\" said the Inspector. \\\"You are at liberty, sir, to\\n     give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I'll sit down, with your leave,\\\" the prisoner said, suiting the\\n     action to the word. \\\"This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and\\n     the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I'm on the\\n     brink of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I\\n     say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no\\n     consequence to me.\\\"\\n\\n     With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began\\n     the following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical\\n     manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace\\n     enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I\\n     have had access to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's\\n     words were taken down exactly as they were uttered.\\n\\n     \\\"It don't much matter to you why I hated these men,\\\" he said; \\\"it's\\n     enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings--a\\n     father and a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their\\n     own lives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime,\\n     it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any\\n     court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should\\n     be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You'd have done\\n     the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my\\n     place.\\n\\n     \\\"That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago.\\n     She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart\\n     over it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed\\n     that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his\\n     last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I\\n     have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his\\n     accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to\\n     tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is\\n     likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and\\n     well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left\\n     for me to hope for, or to desire.\\n\\n     \\\"They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me\\n     to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I\\n     found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving\\n     and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a\\n     cabowner's office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain\\n     sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for\\n     myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along\\n     somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that\\n     of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most\\n     confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted\\n     the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.\\n\\n     \\\"It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were\\n     living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across\\n     them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other\\n     side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them\\n     at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their\\n     recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my\\n     opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.\\n\\n     \\\"They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about\\n     London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my\\n     cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then\\n     they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or\\n     late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get\\n     behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long\\n     as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.\\n\\n     \\\"They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there\\n     was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out\\n     alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind\\n     them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was\\n     drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I\\n     watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but\\n     I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost\\n     come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a\\n     little too soon and leave my work undone.\\n\\n     \\\"At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as\\n     the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive\\n     up to their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a\\n     time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up\\n     my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for\\n     I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston\\n     Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed\\n     them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train,\\n     and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be\\n     another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but\\n     Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in\\n     the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them.\\n     Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that\\n     if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His\\n     companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had\\n     resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a\\n     delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what\\n     Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and\\n     reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that\\n     he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it\\n     up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the\\n     last train he should rejoin him at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which\\n     Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven,\\n     and made his way out of the station.\\n\\n     \\\"The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my\\n     enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but\\n     singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue\\n     precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction\\n     in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that\\n     strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans\\n     arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who\\n     had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It\\n     chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in\\n     looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of\\n     one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and\\n     returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a\\n     duplicate constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one\\n     spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from\\n     interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult\\n     problem which I had now to solve.\\n\\n     \\\"He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops,\\n     staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out\\n     he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was\\n     a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so\\n     close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the\\n     whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of\\n     streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the\\n     Terrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his\\n     intention was in returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab\\n     a hundred yards or so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom\\n     drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets\\n     dry with the talking.\\\"\\n\\n     I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.\\n\\n     \\\"That's better,\\\" he said. \\\"Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour,\\n     or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling\\n     inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men\\n     appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap\\n     whom I had never seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar,\\n     and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a\\n     kick which sent him half across the road. 'You hound,' he cried,\\n     shaking his stick at him; 'I'll teach you to insult an honest girl!'\\n     He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his\\n     cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his\\n     legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing\\n     my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. 'Drive me to Halliday's Private\\n     Hotel,' said he.\\n\\n     \\\"When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy\\n     that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I\\n     drove along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I\\n     might take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted\\n     lane have my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this,\\n     when he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him\\n     again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in,\\n     leaving word that I should wait for him. There he remained until\\n     closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the\\n     game was in my own hands.\\n\\n     \\\"Don't imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would\\n     only have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring\\n     myself to do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for\\n     his life if he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets\\n     which I have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once\\n     janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day\\n     the professor was lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students\\n     some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted from some\\n     South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least\\n     grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which this\\n     preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to\\n     a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this\\n     alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with\\n     a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that\\n     when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one\\n     of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite\\n     as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a\\n     handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me,\\n     and the time had now come when I was to use them.\\n\\n     \\\"It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard\\n     and raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad\\n     within--so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation.\\n     If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for\\n     it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your\\n     reach, you would understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at\\n     it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples\\n     throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier\\n     and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me,\\n     just as plain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were\\n     ahead of me, one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the\\n     house in the Brixton Road.\\n\\n     \\\"There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the\\n     dripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber\\n     all huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm,\\n     'It's time to get out,' I said.\\n\\n     \\\"'All right, cabby,' said he.\\n\\n     \\\"I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,\\n     for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden.\\n     I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a\\n     little top-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him\\n     into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father\\n     and the daughter were walking in front of us.\\n\\n     \\\"'It's infernally dark,' said he, stamping about.\\n\\n     \\\"'We'll soon have a light,' I said, striking a match and putting it\\n     to a wax candle which I had brought with me. 'Now, Enoch Drebber,' I\\n     continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, 'who\\n     am I?'\\n\\n     \\\"He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I\\n     saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features,\\n     which showed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face,\\n     and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth\\n     chattered in his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the\\n     door and laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance\\n     would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul\\n     which now possessed me.\\n\\n     \\\"'You dog!' I said; 'I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.\\n     Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your\\n     wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see\\n     to-morrow's sun rise.' He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I\\n     could see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the\\n     time. The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I\\n     believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not\\n     gushed from my nose and relieved me.\\n\\n     \\\"'What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?' I cried, locking the door,\\n     and shaking the key in his face. 'Punishment has been slow in coming,\\n     but it has overtaken you at last.' I saw his coward lips tremble as I\\n     spoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it\\n     was useless.\\n\\n     \\\"'Would you murder me?' he stammered.\\n\\n     \\\"'There is no murder,' I answered. 'Who talks of murdering a mad dog?\\n     What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from\\n     her slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and\\n     shameless harem.'\\n\\n     \\\"'It was not I who killed her father,' he cried.\\n\\n     \\\"'But it was you who broke her innocent heart,' I shrieked, thrusting\\n     the box before him. 'Let the high God judge between us. Choose and\\n     eat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what\\n     you leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we\\n     are ruled by chance.'\\n\\n     \\\"He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my\\n     knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I\\n     swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a\\n     minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to\\n     die. Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the\\n     first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I\\n     laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy's marriage ring in front of his\\n     eyes. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is\\n     rapid. A spasm of pain contorted his features; he threw his hands out\\n     in front of him, staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily\\n     upon the floor. I turned him over with my foot, and placed my hand\\n     upon his heart. There was no movement. He was dead!\\n\\n     \\\"The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice\\n     of it. I don't know what it was that put it into my head to write\\n     upon the wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of\\n     setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and\\n     cheerful. I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE\\n     written up above him, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers\\n     that the secret societies must have done it. I guessed that what\\n     puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my\\n     finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the\\n     wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody\\n     about, and that the night was still very wild. I had driven some\\n     distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept\\n     Lucy's ring, and found that it was not there. I was thunderstruck at\\n     this, for it was the only memento that I had of her. Thinking that I\\n     might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber's body, I drove\\n     back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the\\n     house--for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring.\\n     When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a\\n     police-officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his\\n     suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.\\n\\n     \\\"That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was\\n     to do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier's debt. I\\n     knew that he was staying at Halliday's Private Hotel, and I hung\\n     about all day, but he never came out. I fancy that he suspected\\n     something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He was\\n     cunning, was Stangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he\\n     could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I\\n     soon found out which was the window of his bedroom, and early next\\n     morning I took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane\\n     behind the hotel, and so made my way into his room in the grey of the\\n     dawn. I woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was\\n     to answer for the life he had taken so long before. I described\\n     Drebber's death to him, and I gave him the same choice of the\\n     poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which\\n     that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat. In\\n     self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would have been the same\\n     in any case, for Providence would never have allowed his guilty hand\\n     to pick out anything but the poison.\\n\\n     \\\"I have little more to say, and it's as well, for I am about done up.\\n     I went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I\\n     could save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the\\n     yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called\\n     Jefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at\\n     221b, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next\\n     thing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and\\n     as neatly snackled as ever I saw in my life. That's the whole of my\\n     story, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold\\n     that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are.\\\"\\n\\n     So thrilling had the man's narrative been, and his manner was so\\n     impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional\\n     detectives, blase as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to\\n     be keenly interested in the man's story. When he finished we sat for\\n     some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching\\n     of Lestrade's pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his\\n     shorthand account.\\n\\n     \\\"There is only one point on which I should like a little more\\n     information,\\\" Sherlock Holmes said at last. \\\"Who was your accomplice\\n     who came for the ring which I advertised?\\\"\\n\\n     The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. \\\"I can tell my own\\n     secrets,\\\" he said, \\\"but I don't get other people into trouble. I saw\\n     your advertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be\\n     the ring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think\\n     you'll own he did it smartly.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Not a doubt of that,\\\" said Holmes heartily.\\n\\n     \\\"Now, gentlemen,\\\" the Inspector remarked gravely, \\\"the forms of the\\n     law must be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought\\n     before the magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until\\n     then I will be responsible for him.\\\" He rang the bell as he spoke,\\n     and Jefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders, while my\\n     friend and I made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to\\n     Baker Street.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER VII\\n          The Conclusion\\n\\n\\n     We had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the\\n     Thursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our\\n     testimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson\\n     Hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would\\n     be meted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism\\n     burst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of\\n     the cell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been\\n     able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on\\n     work well done.\\n\\n     \\\"Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,\\\" Holmes remarked,\\n     as we chatted it over next evening. \\\"Where will their grand\\n     advertisement be now?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I don't see that they had very much to do with his capture,\\\" I\\n     answered.\\n\\n     \\\"What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,\\\" returned\\n     my companion, bitterly. \\\"The question is, what can you make people\\n     believe that you have done. Never mind,\\\" he continued, more brightly,\\n     after a pause. \\\"I would not have missed the investigation for\\n     anything. There has been no better case within my recollection.\\n     Simple as it was, there were several most instructive points about\\n     it.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Simple!\\\" I ejaculated.\\n\\n     \\\"Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,\\\" said\\n     Sherlock Holmes, smiling at my surprise. \\\"The proof of its intrinsic\\n     simplicity is, that without any help save a few very ordinary\\n     deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three\\n     days.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"That is true,\\\" said I.\\n\\n     \\\"I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is\\n     usually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this\\n     sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a\\n     very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not\\n     practise it much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful\\n     to reason forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are\\n     fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason\\n     analytically.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I confess,\\\" said I, \\\"that I do not quite follow you.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it\\n     clearer. Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will\\n     tell you what the result would be. They can put those events together\\n     in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass.\\n     There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would\\n     be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps\\n     were which led up to that result. This power is what I mean when I\\n     talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I understand,\\\" said I.\\n\\n     \\\"Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to\\n     find everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you\\n     the different steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I\\n     approached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely\\n     free from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the\\n     roadway, and there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly\\n     the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been\\n     there during the night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not\\n     a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary\\n     London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman's brougham.\\n\\n     \\\"This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the\\n     garden path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly\\n     suitable for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a\\n     mere trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon\\n     its surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science\\n     which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing\\n     footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much\\n     practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks\\n     of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had\\n     first passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had\\n     been before the others, because in places their marks had been\\n     entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In\\n     this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal\\n     visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height (as I\\n     calculated from the length of his stride), and the other fashionably\\n     dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his\\n     boots.\\n\\n     \\\"On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My\\n     well-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the\\n     murder, if murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man's\\n     person, but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he\\n     had foreseen his fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart\\n     disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit\\n     agitation upon their features. Having sniffed the dead man's lips I\\n     detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he\\n     had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been\\n     forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By\\n     the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other\\n     hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very\\n     unheard of idea. The forcible administration of poison is by no means\\n     a new thing in criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of\\n     Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist.\\n\\n     \\\"And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had\\n     not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it\\n     politics, then, or was it a woman? That was the question which\\n     confronted me. I was inclined from the first to the latter\\n     supposition. Political assassins are only too glad to do their work\\n     and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary, been done most\\n     deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the\\n     room, showing that he had been there all the time. It must have been\\n     a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for such a\\n     methodical revenge. When the inscription was discovered upon the wall\\n     I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too\\n     evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the\\n     question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of\\n     some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson\\n     whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any\\n     particular point in Mr. Drebber's former career. He answered, you\\n     remember, in the negative.\\n\\n     \\\"I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which\\n     confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer's height, and furnished\\n     me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the\\n     length of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since\\n     there were no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the\\n     floor had burst from the murderer's nose in his excitement. I could\\n     perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his\\n     feet. It is seldom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded,\\n     breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion\\n     that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events\\n     proved that I had judged correctly.\\n\\n     \\\"Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected.\\n     I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my\\n     enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch\\n     Drebber. The answer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had\\n     already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in\\n     love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope was at present in\\n     Europe. I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand,\\n     and all that remained was to secure the murderer.\\n\\n     \\\"I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked\\n     into the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had\\n     driven the cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had\\n     wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been\\n     anyone in charge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he\\n     were inside the house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane\\n     man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it\\n     were, of a third person, who was sure to betray him. Lastly,\\n     supposing one man wished to dog another through London, what better\\n     means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver. All these considerations\\n     led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be\\n     found among the jarveys of the Metropolis.\\n\\n     \\\"If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased\\n     to be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden chance\\n     would be likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for\\n     a time at least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason\\n     to suppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he\\n     change his name in a country where no one knew his original one? I\\n     therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them\\n     systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted\\n     out the man that I wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I\\n     took advantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection. The\\n     murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected,\\n     but which could hardly in any case have been prevented. Through it,\\n     as you know, I came into possession of the pills, the existence of\\n     which I had already surmised. You see the whole thing is a chain of\\n     logical sequences without a break or flaw.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It is wonderful!\\\" I cried. \\\"Your merits should be publicly\\n     recognized. You should publish an account of the case. If you won't,\\n     I will for you.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You may do what you like, Doctor,\\\" he answered. \\\"See here!\\\" he\\n     continued, handing a paper over to me, \\\"look at this!\\\"\\n\\n     It was the Echo for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed\\n     was devoted to the case in question.\\n\\n     \\\"The public,\\\" it said, \\\"have lost a sensational treat through the\\n     sudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr.\\n     Enoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case\\n     will probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good\\n     authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and\\n     romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that\\n     both the victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day\\n     Saints, and Hope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake\\n     City. If the case has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out\\n     in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police\\n     force, and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do\\n     wisely to settle their feuds at home, and not to carry them on to\\n     British soil. It is an open secret that the credit of this smart\\n     capture belongs entirely to the well-known Scotland Yard officials,\\n     Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was apprehended, it appears, in\\n     the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an\\n     amateur, shown some talent in the detective line, and who, with such\\n     instructors, may hope in time to attain to some degree of their\\n     skill. It is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be\\n     presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their\\n     services.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Didn't I tell you so when we started?\\\" cried Sherlock Holmes with a\\n     laugh. \\\"That's the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a\\n     testimonial!\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Never mind,\\\" I answered, \\\"I have all the facts in my journal, and\\n     the public shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself\\n     contented by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser--\\n\\n                      \\\"'Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo\\n                 Ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplar in arca.'\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n          \"\\n\\n\\n\\n                              THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\\n\\n                               Arthur Conan Doyle\\n\\n\\n\\n     I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the\\n     autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very\\n     stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an\\n     apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled\\n     me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\\n\\n     \\\"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,\\\"\\n     he said cordially.\\n\\n     \\\"I was afraid that you were engaged.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"So I am. Very much so.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Then I can wait in the next room.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and\\n     helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that\\n     he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.\\\"\\n\\n     The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of\\n     greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small\\n     fat-encircled eyes.\\n\\n     \\\"Try the settee,\\\" said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and\\n     putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial\\n     moods. \\\"I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is\\n     bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday\\n     life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has\\n     prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so,\\n     somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\\\" I\\n     observed.\\n\\n     \\\"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went\\n     into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that\\n     for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life\\n     itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the\\n     imagination.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view,\\n     for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your\\n     reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now,\\n     Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this\\n     morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the\\n     most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard\\n     me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often\\n     connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and\\n     occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any\\n     positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard it is\\n     impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of\\n     crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most\\n     singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would\\n     have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not\\n     merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part\\n     but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to\\n     have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have\\n     heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to\\n     guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to\\n     my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the\\n     facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\\\"\\n\\n     The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some\\n     little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the\\n     inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement\\n     column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon\\n     his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the\\n     fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be\\n     presented by his dress or appearance.\\n\\n     I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore\\n     every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,\\n     pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check\\n     trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front,\\n     and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square\\n     pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat\\n     and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a\\n     chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing\\n     remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the\\n     expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his\\n     head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. \\\"Beyond the\\n     obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he\\n     takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and\\n     that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can\\n     deduce nothing else.\\\"\\n\\n     Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon\\n     the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\\n\\n     \\\"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.\\n     Holmes?\\\" he asked. \\\"How did you know, for example, that I did manual\\n     labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than\\n     your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more\\n     developed.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,\\n     especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use\\n     an arc-and-compass breastpin.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five\\n     inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where\\n     you rest it upon the desk?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Well, but China?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist\\n     could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of\\n     tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the\\n     subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink\\n     is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin\\n     hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\\\"\\n\\n     Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \\\"Well, I never!\\\" said he. \\\"I\\n     thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that\\n     there was nothing in it, after all.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I begin to think, Watson,\\\" said Holmes, \\\"that I make a mistake in\\n     explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor\\n     little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so\\n     candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes, I have got it now,\\\" he answered with his thick red finger\\n     planted halfway down the column. \\\"Here it is. This is what began it\\n     all. You just read it for yourself, sir.\\\"\\n\\n     I took the paper from him and read as follows:\\n\\n     \\\"To the Red-headed League: On account of the bequest of the late\\n     Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now\\n     another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a\\n     salary of \\u00a34 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men\\n     who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years,\\n     are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan\\n     Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What on earth does this mean?\\\" I ejaculated after I had twice read\\n     over the extraordinary announcement.\\n\\n     Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in\\n     high spirits. \\\"It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?\\\" said\\n     he. \\\"And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about\\n     yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had\\n     upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper\\n     and the date.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\\"\\n     said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \\\"I have a small pawnbroker's\\n     business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a very large\\n     affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a\\n     living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep\\n     one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come\\n     for half wages so as to learn the business.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What is the name of this obliging youth?\\\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n     \\\"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either.\\n     It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr.\\n     Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn\\n     twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied,\\n     why should I put ideas in his head?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employee who comes\\n     under the full market price. It is not a common experience among\\n     employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is not as\\n     remarkable as your advertisement.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Oh, he has his faults, too,\\\" said Mr. Wilson. \\\"Never was such a\\n     fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to\\n     be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a\\n     rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault,\\n     but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice in him.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"He is still with you, I presume?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple\\n     cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the house,\\n     for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly,\\n     sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our\\n     debts, if we do nothing more.\\n\\n     \\\"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding,\\n     he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this\\n     very paper in his hand, and he says:\\n\\n     \\\"'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'\\n\\n     \\\"'Why that?' I asks.\\n\\n     \\\"'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the\\n     Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets\\n     it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are\\n     men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the\\n     money. If my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib\\n     all ready for me to step into.'\\n\\n     \\\"'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very\\n     stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having\\n     to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over\\n     the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going on\\n     outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\\n\\n     \\\"'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he asked\\n     with his eyes open.\\n\\n     \\\"'Never.'\\n\\n     \\\"'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the\\n     vacancies.'\\n\\n     \\\"'And what are they worth?' I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and\\n     it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'\\n\\n     \\\"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for\\n     the business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra\\n     couple of hundred would have been very handy.\\n\\n     \\\"'Tell me all about it,' said I.\\n\\n     \\\"'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for\\n     yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address\\n     where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the\\n     League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who\\n     was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had\\n     a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found\\n     that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with\\n     instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to\\n     men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay\\n     and very little to do.'\\n\\n     \\\"'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would\\n     apply.'\\n\\n     \\\"'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is really\\n     confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started\\n     from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a\\n     good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if\\n     your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright,\\n     blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would\\n     just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put\\n     yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'\\n\\n     \\\"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my\\n     hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if\\n     there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a\\n     chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to\\n     know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just\\n     ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away\\n     with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the\\n     business up and started off for the address that was given us in the\\n     advertisement.\\n\\n     \\\"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From\\n     north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his\\n     hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet\\n     Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like\\n     a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so\\n     many in the whole country as were brought together by that single\\n     advertisement. Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange,\\n     brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were\\n     not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how\\n     many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding\\n     would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he\\n     pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and\\n     right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double\\n     stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back\\n     dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found\\n     ourselves in the office.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Your experience has been a most entertaining one,\\\" remarked Holmes\\n     as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of\\n     snuff. \\\"Pray continue your very interesting statement.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a\\n     deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even\\n     redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came\\n     up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would\\n     disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very\\n     easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man\\n     was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he\\n     closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word\\n     with us.\\n\\n     \\\"'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to\\n     fill a vacancy in the League.'\\n\\n     \\\"'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has\\n     every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so\\n     fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and\\n     gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged\\n     forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\\n\\n     \\\"'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I\\n     am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' With that he\\n     seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the\\n     pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'I\\n     perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for\\n     we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell\\n     you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human\\n     nature.' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the\\n     top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of\\n     disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in\\n     different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except\\n     my own and that of the manager.\\n\\n     \\\"'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the\\n     pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a\\n     married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'\\n\\n     \\\"I answered that I had not.\\n\\n     \\\"His face fell immediately.\\n\\n     \\\"'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry\\n     to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation\\n     and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is\\n     exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'\\n\\n     \\\"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not\\n     to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few\\n     minutes he said that it would be all right.\\n\\n     \\\"'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be fatal,\\n     but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of\\n     hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?'\\n\\n     \\\"'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,' said\\n     I.\\n\\n     \\\"'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding. 'I\\n     should be able to look after that for you.'\\n\\n     \\\"'What would be the hours?' I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"'Ten to two.'\\n\\n     \\\"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.\\n     Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before\\n     pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the\\n     mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that\\n     he would see to anything that turned up.\\n\\n     \\\"'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'\\n\\n     \\\"'Is \\u00a34 a week.'\\n\\n     \\\"'And the work?'\\n\\n     \\\"'Is purely nominal.'\\n\\n     \\\"'What do you call purely nominal?'\\n\\n     \\\"'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building,\\n     the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position\\n     forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't comply\\n     with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.'\\n\\n     \\\"'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,'\\n     said I.\\n\\n     \\\"'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor\\n     business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your\\n     billet.'\\n\\n     \\\"'And the work?'\\n\\n     \\\"'Is to copy out the \\\"Encyclopaedia Britannica.\\\" There is the first\\n     volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and\\n     blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be\\n     ready to-morrow?'\\n\\n     \\\"'Certainly,' I answered.\\n\\n     \\\"'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once\\n     more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough\\n     to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my\\n     assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my\\n     own good fortune.\\n\\n     \\\"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low\\n     spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair\\n     must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I\\n     could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could\\n     make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing\\n     anything so simple as copying out the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica.'\\n     Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I\\n     had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I\\n     determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of\\n     ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I\\n     started off for Pope's Court.\\n\\n     \\\"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as\\n     possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was\\n     there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the\\n     letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time\\n     to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he bade me\\n     good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and\\n     locked the door of the office after me.\\n\\n     \\\"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager\\n     came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work.\\n     It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning\\n     I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.\\n     Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after\\n     a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to\\n     leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,\\n     and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I\\n     would not risk the loss of it.\\n\\n     \\\"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots\\n     and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with\\n     diligence that I might get on to the B's before very long. It cost me\\n     something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my\\n     writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"To an end?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual\\n     at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little\\n     square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a\\n     tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.\\\"\\n\\n     He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of\\n     note-paper. It read in this fashion:\\n\\n                              The Red-headed League\\n                                       is\\n                                    Dissolved\\n                                October 9, 1890.\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful\\n     face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely\\n     overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a\\n     roar of laughter.\\n\\n     \\\"I cannot see that there is anything very funny,\\\" cried our client,\\n     flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. \\\"If you can do nothing\\n     better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"No, no,\\\" cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he\\n     had half risen. \\\"I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It\\n     is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my\\n     saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps\\n     did you take when you found the card upon the door?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at\\n     the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.\\n     Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the\\n     ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of\\n     the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such\\n     body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the\\n     name was new to him.\\n\\n     \\\"'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'\\n\\n     \\\"'What, the red-headed man?'\\n\\n     \\\"'Yes.'\\n\\n     \\\"'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and\\n     was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises\\n     were ready. He moved out yesterday.'\\n\\n     \\\"'Where could I find him?'\\n\\n     \\\"'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King\\n     Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'\\n\\n     \\\"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a\\n     manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard\\n     of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And what did you do then?\\\" asked Holmes.\\n\\n     \\\"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my\\n     assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say\\n     that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good\\n     enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a\\n     struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice\\n     to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And you did very wisely,\\\" said Holmes. \\\"Your case is an exceedingly\\n     remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you\\n     have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from\\n     it than might at first sight appear.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Grave enough!\\\" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. \\\"Why, I have lost four pound a\\n     week.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"As far as you are personally concerned,\\\" remarked Holmes, \\\"I do not\\n     see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On\\n     the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some \\u00a330, to say\\n     nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every\\n     subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by\\n     them.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and\\n     what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon\\n     me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and\\n     thirty pounds.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one\\n     or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first\\n     called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with\\n     you?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"About a month then.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"How did he come?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"In answer to an advertisement.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Was he the only applicant?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"No, I had a dozen.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Why did you pick him?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Because he was handy and would come cheap.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"At half-wages, in fact.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,\\n     though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his\\n     forehead.\\\"\\n\\n     Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. \\\"I thought as\\n     much,\\\" said he. \\\"Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for\\n     earrings?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a\\n     lad.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Hum!\\\" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. \\\"He is still with\\n     you?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And has your business been attended to in your absence?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a\\n     morning.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion\\n     upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday,\\n     and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Well, Watson,\\\" said Holmes when our visitor had left us, \\\"what do\\n     you make of it all?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I make nothing of it,\\\" I answered frankly. \\\"It is a most mysterious\\n     business.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"As a rule,\\\" said Holmes, \\\"the more bizarre a thing is the less\\n     mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless\\n     crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the\\n     most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What are you going to do, then?\\\" I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"To smoke,\\\" he answered. \\\"It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg\\n     that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes.\\\" He curled himself up\\n     in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and\\n     there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting\\n     out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion\\n     that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he\\n     suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has\\n     made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\\n\\n     \\\"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon,\\\" he remarked.\\n     \\\"What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few\\n     hours?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first,\\n     and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good\\n     deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my\\n     taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to\\n     introspect. Come along!\\\"\\n\\n     We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short\\n     walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story\\n     which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little,\\n     shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick\\n     houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of\\n     weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight\\n     against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls\\n     and a brown board with \\\"Jabez Wilson\\\" in white letters, upon a corner\\n     house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his\\n     business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one\\n     side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between\\n     puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down\\n     again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he\\n     returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the\\n     pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door\\n     and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking,\\n     clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\\n\\n     \\\"Thank you,\\\" said Holmes, \\\"I only wished to ask you how you would go\\n     from here to the Strand.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Third right, fourth left,\\\" answered the assistant promptly, closing\\n     the door.\\n\\n     \\\"Smart fellow, that,\\\" observed Holmes as we walked away. \\\"He is, in\\n     my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am\\n     not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something\\n     of him before.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Evidently,\\\" said I, \\\"Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal\\n     in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired\\n     your way merely in order that you might see him.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Not him.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What then?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"The knees of his trousers.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And what did you see?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What I expected to see.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Why did you beat the pavement?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are\\n     spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.\\n     Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\\\"\\n\\n     The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner\\n     from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to\\n     it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main\\n     arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and\\n     west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce\\n     flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were\\n     black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to\\n     realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business\\n     premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded\\n     and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\\n\\n     \\\"Let me see,\\\" said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along\\n     the line, \\\"I should like just to remember the order of the houses\\n     here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London.\\n     There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the\\n     Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian\\n     Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us\\n     right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so\\n     it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then\\n     off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony,\\n     and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\\\"\\n\\n     My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very\\n     capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the\\n     afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,\\n     gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his\\n     gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those\\n     of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\\n     ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his\\n     singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and\\n     his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often\\n     thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\\n     occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him\\n     from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was\\n     never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been\\n     lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter\\n     editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come\\n     upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the\\n     level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his\\n     methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not\\n     that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in\\n     the music at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be\\n     coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\\n\\n     \\\"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,\\\" he remarked as we emerged.\\n\\n     \\\"Yes, it would be as well.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This\\n     business at Coburg Square is serious.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Why serious?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to\\n     believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being\\n     Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help\\n     to-night.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"At what time?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Ten will be early enough.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I shall be at Baker Street at ten.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so\\n     kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\\\" He waved his hand,\\n     turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\n\\n     I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always\\n     oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with\\n     Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what\\n     he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw\\n     clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen,\\n     while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I\\n     drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the\\n     extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the \\\"Encyclopaedia\\\"\\n     down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with\\n     which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and\\n     why should I go armed?  Where were we going, and what were we to do?\\n     I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's\\n     assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I\\n     tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter\\n     aside until night should bring an explanation.\\n\\n     It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way\\n     across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two\\n     hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I\\n     heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room I found\\n     Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I\\n     recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other\\n     was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and\\n     oppressively respectable frock-coat.\\n\\n     \\\"Ha! Our party is complete,\\\" said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket\\n     and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. \\\"Watson, I think you\\n     know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.\\n     Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,\\\" said Jones in his\\n     consequential way. \\\"Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a\\n     chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running\\n     down.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\\\"\\n     observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\\n\\n     \\\"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,\\\" said the\\n     police agent loftily. \\\"He has his own little methods, which are, if\\n     he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and\\n     fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not\\n     too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto\\n     murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than\\n     the official force.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\\\" said the stranger\\n     with deference. \\\"Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the\\n     first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had\\n     my rubber.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I think you will find,\\\" said Sherlock Holmes, \\\"that you will play\\n     for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the\\n     play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will\\n     be some \\u00a330,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you\\n     wish to lay your hands.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a young\\n     man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I\\n     would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London.\\n     He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a\\n     royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is\\n     as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every\\n     turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a crib\\n     in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in\\n     Cornwall the next. I've been on his track for years and have never\\n     set eyes on him yet.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.\\n     I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree\\n     with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten,\\n     however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the\\n     first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.\\\"\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and\\n     lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the\\n     afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\\n     until we emerged into Farrington Street.\\n\\n     \\\"We are close there now,\\\" my friend remarked. \\\"This fellow\\n     Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the\\n     matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a\\n     bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one\\n     positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a\\n     lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are\\n     waiting for us.\\\"\\n\\n     We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\\n     ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the\\n     guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and\\n     through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small\\n     corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was\\n     opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which\\n     terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to\\n     light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling\\n     passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or\\n     cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\\n\\n     \\\"You are not very vulnerable from above,\\\" Holmes remarked as he held\\n     up the lantern and gazed about him.\\n\\n     \\\"Nor from below,\\\" said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the\\n     flags which lined the floor. \\\"Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\\\"\\n     he remarked, looking up in surprise.\\n\\n     \\\"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\\\" said Holmes\\n     severely. \\\"You have already imperilled the whole success of our\\n     expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down\\n     upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\\\"\\n\\n     The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\\n     injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees\\n     upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to\\n     examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds\\n     sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his\\n     glass in his pocket.\\n\\n     \\\"We have at least an hour before us,\\\" he remarked, \\\"for they can\\n     hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.\\n     Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work\\n     the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present,\\n     Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City\\n     branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the\\n     chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are\\n     reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a\\n     considerable interest in this cellar at present.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It is our French gold,\\\" whispered the director. \\\"We have had several\\n     warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Your French gold?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\\n     borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.\\n     It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the\\n     money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which\\n     I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil.\\n     Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept\\n     in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon\\n     the subject.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Which were very well justified,\\\" observed Holmes. \\\"And now it is\\n     time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour\\n     matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we\\n     must put the screen over that dark lantern.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And sit in the dark?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\\n     thought that, as we were a partie carr\\u00e9e, you might have your rubber\\n     after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far\\n     that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we\\n     must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall\\n     take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are\\n     careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal\\n     yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close\\n     in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting\\n     them down.\\\"\\n\\n     I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\\n     which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his\\n     lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I\\n     have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to\\n     assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a\\n     moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of\\n     expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden\\n     gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\\n\\n     \\\"They have but one retreat,\\\" whispered Holmes. \\\"That is back through\\n     the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I\\n     asked you, Jones?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and\\n     wait.\\\"\\n\\n     What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an\\n     hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have\\n     almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary\\n     and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were\\n     worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so\\n     acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my\\n     companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of\\n     the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director.\\n     From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the\\n     floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\\n\\n     At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it\\n     lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\\n     warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,\\n     almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little\\n     area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing\\n     fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as\\n     suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid\\n     spark which marked a chink between the stones.\\n\\n     Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,\\n     tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its\\n     side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light\\n     of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face,\\n     which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of\\n     the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one\\n     knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of\\n     the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\\n     himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\\n\\n     \\\"It's all clear,\\\" he whispered. \\\"Have you the chisel and the bags?\\n     Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!\\\"\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\\n     The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth\\n     as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of\\n     a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist,\\n     and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\\n\\n     \\\"It's no use, John Clay,\\\" said Holmes blandly. \\\"You have no chance at\\n     all.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"So I see,\\\" the other answered with the utmost coolness. \\\"I fancy\\n     that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"There are three men waiting for him at the door,\\\" said Holmes.\\n\\n     \\\"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\\n     compliment you.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And I you,\\\" Holmes answered. \\\"Your red-headed idea was very new and\\n     effective.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You'll see your pal again presently,\\\" said Jones. \\\"He's quicker at\\n     climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the\\n     derbies.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\\\" remarked\\n     our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. \\\"You may not\\n     be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness,\\n     also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please.'\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"All right,\\\" said Jones with a stare and a snigger. \\\"Well, would you\\n     please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\\n     Highness to the police-station?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"That is better,\\\" said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to\\n     the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the\\n     detective.\\n\\n     \\\"Really, Mr. Holmes,\\\" said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from\\n     the cellar, \\\"I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\\n     There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most\\n     complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery\\n     that have ever come within my experience.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.\\n     John Clay,\\\" said Holmes. \\\"I have been at some small expense over this\\n     matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am\\n     amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways\\n     unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the\\n     Red-headed League.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You see, Watson,\\\" he explained in the early hours of the morning as\\n     we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \\\"it was\\n     perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of\\n     this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League,\\n     and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get this not\\n     over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every\\n     day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be\\n     difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to\\n     Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. The \\u00a34\\n     a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who\\n     were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue\\n     has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply\\n     for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning\\n     in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come\\n     for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive\\n     for securing the situation.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"But how could you guess what the motive was?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere\\n     vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's\\n     business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which\\n     could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an\\n     expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the\\n     house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for\\n     photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar!\\n     There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to\\n     this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of\\n     the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing\\n     something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for\\n     months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing\\n     save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.\\n\\n     \\\"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I\\n     surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was\\n     ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It\\n     was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the\\n     assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never\\n     set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His\\n     knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how\\n     worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of\\n     burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for.\\n     I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on\\n     our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When\\n     you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon\\n     the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have\\n     seen.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\\\"\\n     I asked.\\n\\n     \\\"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that\\n     they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other\\n     words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential\\n     that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the\\n     bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any\\n     other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all\\n     these reasons I expected them to come to-night.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You reasoned it out beautifully,\\\" I exclaimed in unfeigned\\n     admiration. \\\"It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It saved me from ennui,\\\" he answered, yawning. \\\"Alas! I already feel\\n     it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape\\n     from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to\\n     do so.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And you are a benefactor of the race,\\\" said I.\\n\\n     He shrugged his shoulders. \\\"Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some\\n     little use,\\\" he remarked. \\\"'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,'\\n     as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
